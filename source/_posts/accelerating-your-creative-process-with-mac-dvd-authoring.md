Meanwhile, you can also edit the videos if you like before clicking on Export. For instance, you can simply utilize the one-click preset options to apply effects, transition, and more. Or you can color-correct the video files, crop, trim, split, or do several other things before burning the video to DVD. The preview section allows you to view the edited video.

**Step 3:** **Export video to DVD**

After editing, you click on Export toggle and hover to the ‘DVD’ section within the Export options. You can choose other options present. Finally, you can burn video to DVD in DVD disc, DVD folder, and ISO disc image file format
