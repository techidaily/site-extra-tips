**Hands-Free Recording** – You generally shoot Snapchat video by holding the camera button. Therefore, one hand always stays engaged. However, you can capture Snapchat video hands-free by creative Gesture from Assistive Touch.

**Switch Camera While Recording** – There are times when you may want to shoot with your front camera and rear camera a few moments later. When you shoot Snapchat video, you can switch between the cameras simply by double tap on the screen. For example, if you are shooting with the front camera, you can double tap on the screen to shoot from rear camera now.

**Record Video with External Music –** Snapchat has a wide range of music to add to your videos. However, you may not find the latest ones there. In such a case, if you want to add the latest song to your video, you should play the song on any music app you have. Thereafter, open Snapchat and start shooting the video. The background song from the music app will be recorded in your Snapchat video. All you have to do is time the video perfectly so that the song can sync with your video.

**Send Video Without Any Sound** – If you want to record a short video on Snapchat and send it across to your friends without the audio part or any sound, you can do it instantly. All you need to do is record the video as usual and then tap on the Microphone icon located at the bottom-left corner. Finally, hit the Send button and the video will reach your friend with any sound.
