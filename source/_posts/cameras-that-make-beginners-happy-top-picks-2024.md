If you are just getting started in the world of videography and photography, you may be curious about your options.

In this article, we are going to share what you need to look for in a great camera. Plus, we’re going to help you look at the different digital cameras for beginners so that you can find one that is right for you and your needs.

## Part 1: How Do I Choose a Camera

There are hundreds of cameras available to choose from. How do you know which one is going to be right for your purposes? Here’s a quick look at some of the most important traits that you’ll want to keep an eye out for during your search.

* **Portability**: If you want to make sure that you can take your camera with you everywhere, then a simple point and click option may be perfect for what you’re looking for. While these typically have a fixed lens, the technology for these cameras have gotten a lot better at providing flexibility and excellent results, as well. In many cases, beginners benefit from using a simple [point-and-click camera](https://www.digitaltrends.com/photography/best-point-and-shoot-cameras/) at first.
* **Budget**: You always want to be sure that you look at price when you’re looking at beginner cameras. More often than not, you’re going to want to get something that is relatively affordable without sacrificing quality. You may not know whether or not you want to pursue this whole picture and video hobby, and a cheaper camera will make it easier to sell if you find it’s not for you.
* **Lenses**: If you’re someone that is looking to step into something a little more complicated, you may also want the flexibility to [switch out the lenses](https://lifehacker.com/the-fastest-way-to-change-lenses-on-your-dslr-1191321251) that you’re using. Point and click cameras typically don’t have this capability, but you can still find some reasonably affordable options that allow for you to switch lenses in and out.

### 1\. Is Canon or Nikon better for beginners?

In all honesty, it depends on what you’re looking for. Similar models are similarly priced, which makes a choice all the more difficult. Both Canon and Nikon make beginner level cameras – the T7i and the D5600, respectively.

The T7i has a better sensor and ends up being much lighter than the Canon model. But, on the other hand, the shooting FPS and the number of autofocus points are better on the [Nikon D5600](https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/dslr-cameras/d5600.html). So, if you have some preferences related to what you’re shooting or how you want to shoot it, you’ll want to choose one over the other.

### 1\. Is Canon or Nikon better for beginners?

In all honesty, it depends on what you’re looking for. Similar models are similarly priced, which makes a choice all the more difficult. Both Canon and Nikon make beginner level cameras – the T7i and the D5600, respectively.

The T7i has a better sensor and ends up being much lighter than the Canon model. But, on the other hand, the shooting FPS and the number of autofocus points are better on the [Nikon D5600](https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/dslr-cameras/d5600.html). So, if you have some preferences related to what you’re shooting or how you want to shoot it, you’ll want to choose one over the other.

## Part 1: How Do I Choose a Camera

There are hundreds of cameras available to choose from. How do you know which one is going to be right for your purposes? Here’s a quick look at some of the most important traits that you’ll want to keep an eye out for during your search.

* **Portability**: If you want to make sure that you can take your camera with you everywhere, then a simple point and click option may be perfect for what you’re looking for. While these typically have a fixed lens, the technology for these cameras have gotten a lot better at providing flexibility and excellent results, as well. In many cases, beginners benefit from using a simple [point-and-click camera](https://www.digitaltrends.com/photography/best-point-and-shoot-cameras/) at first.
* **Budget**: You always want to be sure that you look at price when you’re looking at beginner cameras. More often than not, you’re going to want to get something that is relatively affordable without sacrificing quality. You may not know whether or not you want to pursue this whole picture and video hobby, and a cheaper camera will make it easier to sell if you find it’s not for you.
* **Lenses**: If you’re someone that is looking to step into something a little more complicated, you may also want the flexibility to [switch out the lenses](https://lifehacker.com/the-fastest-way-to-change-lenses-on-your-dslr-1191321251) that you’re using. Point and click cameras typically don’t have this capability, but you can still find some reasonably affordable options that allow for you to switch lenses in and out.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### 1\. Is Canon or Nikon better for beginners?

In all honesty, it depends on what you’re looking for. Similar models are similarly priced, which makes a choice all the more difficult. Both Canon and Nikon make beginner level cameras – the T7i and the D5600, respectively.

The T7i has a better sensor and ends up being much lighter than the Canon model. But, on the other hand, the shooting FPS and the number of autofocus points are better on the [Nikon D5600](https://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/dslr-cameras/d5600.html). So, if you have some preferences related to what you’re shooting or how you want to shoot it, you’ll want to choose one over the other.
