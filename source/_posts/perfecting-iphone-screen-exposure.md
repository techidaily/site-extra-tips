iPhone users or any other device, capturing every essence of life and watching them closely can rejuvenate your routined dull life. Often a video gives access to small happiness that you left behind with time. Don’t you think it would be a great idea if you could zoom videos on every device?

## Part1: Why You Need to Zoom in/out

For a long time, only the photo could be zoomed in/out on iPhone. If users wanted to record a zoom video on iPhone that was not possible. But, with the coming of iPhone 7 Plus, users can zoom in/out while recording. If you want to record something that is far from you, zoom in can give you a clearer vision of the object and also let you watch using the zoom for iPhone later, which makes it highly desirable.

## Conclusion

With the advent of a number of unique apps like Filmora, the zoom video on iPhone can be enjoyed by all the iOS users. You can easily add clarity to the video by adding zoom in effects that can be created using Filmora and other similar apps. The zoom for iPhone feature can even help you see the real colors of the butterfly sitting on a flower quite far from you, which I feel is a complete treat to the eyes. Nature comes closer to you through the lenses of your iPhone camera. Enjoy the feature and if you cannot, then don’t lose your heart, try Filmora.

## Conclusion

With the advent of a number of unique apps like Filmora, the zoom video on iPhone can be enjoyed by all the iOS users. You can easily add clarity to the video by adding zoom in effects that can be created using Filmora and other similar apps. The zoom for iPhone feature can even help you see the real colors of the butterfly sitting on a flower quite far from you, which I feel is a complete treat to the eyes. Nature comes closer to you through the lenses of your iPhone camera. Enjoy the feature and if you cannot, then don’t lose your heart, try Filmora.
