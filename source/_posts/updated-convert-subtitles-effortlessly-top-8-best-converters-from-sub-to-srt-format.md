<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Compatible formats

Check if the application is compatible with SUB subtitle and SRT extensions or not. Besides, check if the app supports the desirable format if you want to convert the SRT file to another format.

### 4\. Stability

The application shouldn't be impacted due to viruses. It must not corrupt or introduce non-understandable text blocks in the SRT file.

## Final words

You should go for the best application or online tool to convert the SUB to SRT files. Pay attention to your purpose and experience before choosing the best software. In addition, if you want to access full edit and conversion features, check the pricing plans and ensure they are within your affordable range.
