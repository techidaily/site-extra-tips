Here's the step-by-step guide to creating a completely creating new blank on Instagram to watch live anonymously:

##### Step1 Use A Temporary Email Generator

Since the commonly used emails are limited to creating only one Instagram account, and you might not need a new account frequently, you can try creating a temporary mailbox.

To do so, visit the [**Temp Mail**](https://temp-mail.org/en/) website, and you will get a new temporary email address. Copy the address and use it to create an Instagram account for the next step.

### Method 2\. Change Your Account Name

Another way to **watch Instagram live anonymously** is to change your account info. The platform allows you to edit your username twice in 14 days. However, make sure not to use your own common element or expression habit. Otherwise, you might end up grabbing attention to your profile.

### Method 3\. Watch The Live Replay
