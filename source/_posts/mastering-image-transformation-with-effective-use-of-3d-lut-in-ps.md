## How to Import 3D LUT to Photoshop

There are some 3D LUTs that Adobe Photoshop provides. Usually, these LUTs are limited and are not very effective when working on major projects. Most people, therefore, prefer to add their own 3D LUTs to Photoshop.

There are two ways to import 3D LUT to Photoshop; Adding LUTs to a specific project and Installing LUTs.

Before applying any of the two methods, you need to ensure you have your LUTs right there. You can purchase them or get them for free. Download them to your computer device.

#### Method 1\. Adding LUTs to a Particular Project

This first step is undemanding since you only have to locate a given LUT and then directly incorporate it into your project.

● When using LUTs, there are a couple of things that you need to have right under your nose:

* Make sure that the white balance is accurate
* Carry out small adjustments to your footage, i.e., saturation and contrast, for you to obtain exemplary results
* Have correct exposure. You can use a histogram to aid you in this.
