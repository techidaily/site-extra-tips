**Tips**: You can't adjust the music on your videos

Although Clips can be considered as a convenient app, it doesn’t allow the users to adjust the sound once they add music to video on iPhone. Taking instance, the users will not get enough freedom if they wish to do any modifications to the initial point of the video file. The audio will automatically adjust by ‘Clips’ matching the video the best way possible. For adjusting the audio, people will require an extra hand of any video editing app for the purpose.

## Part 3: How to add music to a video on iPhone with [iMovie](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id377298193)

Another way we would like to introduce is [using iMovie to add music to video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on iPhone. This app will let you add background music to video on iPhone with the steps given below. Thus, go along the steps to get the method learned.

Firstly, open the iMovie app on your device and go to the “Project” section which is located at the top screen.

Next, you need to tap on the “Create Project” which is available as a ‘+’ icon. Afterward, you will notice two panels namely, ‘Movie” and “Trailer”. Choose the former one followed by tapping on the “Create” option.

When this is done, your project interface will be on the screen. Subsequently, go to the “Media” icon located at the top left corner at the timeline. The videos gallery will appear on the screen. Choose one in which you want to add the music and tap on the “Add” icon. The source video will now add to the timeline of iMovie.

Scroll the timeline to the initial point of the video in order to add the music at the point.

Now you can add music by following the same procedure that we did for adding video from the gallery. This will add the music successfully. Please make sure to place the music at background if you want low volume music. The “Background” option will be at the bottom of the screen.

Now, tap the “Play” button to preview the video along with the music. Once satisfied, tap on “Done” placed at the left corner of the screen.

Tip: If your video’s duration is more than the audio duration, iMovie will automatically loop the background music. Therefore, there is an option to adjust the length of the media file. You can set it according to your preference. Check the guide about [How to edit videos with iMovie](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)for more details.

## Part 4: How to add music to iPhone video with [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

It is the most leading and popular way which one can use to [add background music to a video.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) With a bunch of effects, filters, themes and features ability, the software proves to be better than anything else.

In the following part, I’ll take Filmora for Windows as an example to illustrate **how to add music to iPhone videos.** The steps on Filmora for Mac are similar.

Step 1 – Import iPhone Videos to Filmora

Launch Wondershare Filmora and begin with importing the iPhone source video file to Filmora. Choose “Import” and then go to the “Import from a Camera or a Phone” option.

Step 2 – Add Music and Sound Effect to Video

Filmora features an Audio Library which contains royalty-free music tracks and sound effects to choose from. Go for the one you find pleasant and drop it to the Audio track on the timeline. If you want to add your own music, you can simply import the files using the “My music” option on the left toolbar.

![Filmora Audio Library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-audio-library.jpg)

Step 3 – Edit Soundtrack

Prior to the finalization of the video, you can also edit the soundtrack for example; you can speed up the sound or [add fade in/out effect.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) You can also start equalizer etc.

Filmora allows you to save the video in different formats, or share to YouTube, Vimeo directly, or burn to DVD. Besides, you can also choose to save the iPhone videos for different devices in the Device tab.

**Tips**: You can't adjust the music on your videos

Although Clips can be considered as a convenient app, it doesn’t allow the users to adjust the sound once they add music to video on iPhone. Taking instance, the users will not get enough freedom if they wish to do any modifications to the initial point of the video file. The audio will automatically adjust by ‘Clips’ matching the video the best way possible. For adjusting the audio, people will require an extra hand of any video editing app for the purpose.

**Tips**: You can't adjust the music on your videos

Although Clips can be considered as a convenient app, it doesn’t allow the users to adjust the sound once they add music to video on iPhone. Taking instance, the users will not get enough freedom if they wish to do any modifications to the initial point of the video file. The audio will automatically adjust by ‘Clips’ matching the video the best way possible. For adjusting the audio, people will require an extra hand of any video editing app for the purpose.

## Part 3: How to add music to a video on iPhone with [iMovie](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id377298193)

Another way we would like to introduce is [using iMovie to add music to video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on iPhone. This app will let you add background music to video on iPhone with the steps given below. Thus, go along the steps to get the method learned.

Firstly, open the iMovie app on your device and go to the “Project” section which is located at the top screen.

Next, you need to tap on the “Create Project” which is available as a ‘+’ icon. Afterward, you will notice two panels namely, ‘Movie” and “Trailer”. Choose the former one followed by tapping on the “Create” option.

When this is done, your project interface will be on the screen. Subsequently, go to the “Media” icon located at the top left corner at the timeline. The videos gallery will appear on the screen. Choose one in which you want to add the music and tap on the “Add” icon. The source video will now add to the timeline of iMovie.

Scroll the timeline to the initial point of the video in order to add the music at the point.

Now you can add music by following the same procedure that we did for adding video from the gallery. This will add the music successfully. Please make sure to place the music at background if you want low volume music. The “Background” option will be at the bottom of the screen.

Now, tap the “Play” button to preview the video along with the music. Once satisfied, tap on “Done” placed at the left corner of the screen.

Tip: If your video’s duration is more than the audio duration, iMovie will automatically loop the background music. Therefore, there is an option to adjust the length of the media file. You can set it according to your preference. Check the guide about [How to edit videos with iMovie](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)for more details.
