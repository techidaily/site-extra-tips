Well, to save you from stress, we've created this give to explain all you need to know about coming up with a good podcast name. Plus, you'll discover over fifty podcast name ideas that you can use to start your journey as a podcaster.

## Part 1: Why Does a Podcast Name Matter?

As mentioned earlier, a podcast name gives listeners the first impression of your podcast. But it's not just that - it's also;

* **Your Brand Identity in the industry:** As a podcaster, your name indicates your brand. It is what people will tag you with whenever they try to remember your show.
* **The power behind your potential listeners' first impression:** With a good podcast name, you can easily communicate who you are and the value of the information listeners could get once they start listening to the podcast.

## Part 2: How to come up with A Cool and Catchy Podcast Name

When thinking of a perfect name for your podcast channel, several things should be considered. It ranges from making it short and sweet to consider your target audience, incorporating your brand name, and much more. Keep reading to find out more.

### 1\. The topic of your show

![topics of shows](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/name-generator-podcast-1.jpg)

The name you choose for your podcast channel must revolve around what your show will be all about. It does not matter if you intend to make the name playful or plain. Just make sure you choose a name that gives your audience a concise idea of what information to expect from the podcast show.

### 2\. Target audience

![podcast target audience](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/name-generator-podcast-2.jpg)

When choosing a podcast name, it would be best to keep your target audience in mind. What phrase is popular among them? What kind of tone would make your podcast name attract them? Etc. You should do thorough research and find out what your audience likes. Thus, it will help you decide on a podcast name your audience can relate to.

### 3\. Searchability

![podcast to be found](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/name-generator-podcast-3.jpg)

Having a searchable podcast name is very smart, and you can do so by incorporating keywords related to the theme of your show into your podcast name. Doing so will not just help you improve your podcast title SEO ranking but also enhance its potential to appear more in search queries, thus impacting your podcast audience growth.

### 4\. Make it short and rememberable

Research shows that 75% of podcast names online are 29 characters or less. So, avoid lengthy words. Although you can use up to 225 characters in your podcast name, it's better to make it short and memorable, and it should convey the value of your show to your audience. For example, if your podcast is about football, you can use Football Weekly Roundup, EPL Digest, etc. Using short names will make it easy for first-timers to remember your podcast name the next time they intend to search it online.
