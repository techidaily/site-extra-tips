## Part 1\. Do I Need an Audio Mixer for Podcasting?

The question that you must be asking yourself is, "Do I even need a mixer for podcasting?' Well, the answer is simple. You don't necessarily need a lemon squeezer, but it helps extract all the juice quickly. Likewise, audio mixers are unnecessary, but they make your job easy.

Using an audio mixer for podcasts improves the audio quality, and the preamps will be nicer. A mixer will also give you more control and options to play around with. But the best part is that it saves you a lot of time in post-production.

If you use an audio mixer to its full potential, you might even be able to record the complete podcast in one flow and avoid post-production altogether. Now that you understand the need for a mixer let us look at the editors' favorite podcast mixers.

## Part 2\. Editor's Favorite Mixers for Podcasting

Based on the features and functionality of podcast mixers, some editors have rated the following three podcast mixers as their favorites.

### 1\. [Rode RODECaster Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Rode-RODECaster-Podcast-Production-Studio/dp/B07M5LQ1YZ)

The RodeCaster Pro is among the best Pro-level podcast mixers. It works as a unique "all-in-one" solution and is all you need to create incredible podcasts. It features four microphone inputs, eight programmable sound boards, nine language options, and much more.

![rodecaster pro podcast production studio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/10-best-mixers-for-podcasting-in-2022-1.jpg)

Furthermore, it can work in isolation and save and store audio on the microSD card. Therefore, it is best suited for recording live podcasts and integrating remote guests.

The Rode RodeCaster Pro, priced at $430, is a complete game-changer if you are into podcasting for the long haul.

### 2\. [Behringer Xenyx Q802USB](https://www.amazon.com/Behringer-Q802USB-Premium-8-Input-Preamps/dp/B084RC1TSQ)

Next on the list is the Behringer Xenyx Q802USB, another top-notch mixer that editors recommend. It is a USB interface mixer connecting your computer with a USB cable. It is not a sole unit but works with different instruments.

![behringer xenyx q802usb](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/10-best-mixers-for-podcasting-in-2022-2.jpg)

It has 2 XLR microphone inputs, 2 stereo inputs, and multiple audio outputs. Moreover, the preamps are pretty good (go up to 60 DB) too. This audio mixer will step up your podcasting gear game. The Behringer Xenyx Q802USB costs around $95 and is your ticket to great sound quality.

### 3\. [PreSonus StudioLive AR8c](https://www.amazon.com/PreSonus-StudioLive-AR8c-8-Channel-Performance/dp/B081BCJDKQ)

Last but not least is the PreSonus StudioLive AR8c. AR8c is a great fit for anyone who wants to upgrade from a simple two-channel interface.

Similar to the previous two recommendations, this also gives great sound quality. You also get more control over your recording process.

![presonus studiolive ar8c](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/10-best-mixers-for-podcasting-in-2022-3.jpg)

The PreSonus StudioLive AR8c is an 8-channel analog mixer with 4 balanced mic inputs. The mic inputs have XMAX preamps which give you a nice clear sound. It also has 2 stereo and 2 mono channels.

Each channel has level control, 3-band semi-parametric EQ, pan, mute, FX, aux, and PFL controls. It also features the "Stereo Super Channel," which allows you to connect your phone or other devices with the mixer. Priced at $499, this audio mixer is going to rock your podcasting game.

We have given you an overview of the top three picks of editors but let us go into a bit more detail about the top 10 best mixers for podcasting.

## Part 3\. The 10 Best Mixers for Podcasting in 2022

If you are looking for a mixer with a complete set of podcast functions within your price range, here is a list of the 10 best podcasting mixers. These 10 mixers vary in their features and prices. Thus, giving you a ton of variety to choose from. So, let's get started.

### 1\. [Rode RodeCaster Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Rode-RODECaster-Podcast-Production-Studio/dp/B07M5LQ1YZ/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?keywords=rode+rodecaster+pro&qid=1666871235&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI0LjMyIiwicXNhIjoiMy41NiIsInFzcCI6IjIuNDkifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=Rode+Rod%2Caps%2C453&sr=8-1)

The Rode RodeCaster Pro is one of the few mixers explicitly designed for podcasts. As a result, it is one of the greatest mixers available in the market. All you need is a good mic to use with it, and you are on your way to creating a fantastic podcast.

![the rode rodecaster pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/10-best-mixers-for-podcasting-in-2022-4.jpg)

The RodeCaster Pro is a digital mixer that works best for multi-person podcasts. It helps record up to four people locally and bring in a remote or telephonic guest. In addition, the simplicity of the RodeCaster Pro is exceptional such that you can even carry it around with you and record podcasts on the go.

With this mixer, you can record on separate channels, which gives you a lot of flexibility in post-production. It also gives you more control over individual microphones.

**What You'll Love:**

The RodeCaster Pro offers a wide variety of features to you.

**● Four Mic Inputs**

With its four microphone inputs and a smartphone, USB, and Bluetooth channels, you can talk to up to five people simultaneously.

**● Eight Programmable SoundBoards**

Apart from that, it has eight programmable soundboards. You can customize these soundboards and add sound clips you will need during your podcast.

**● microSD card Storage**

Lastly, one of the best parts is that it is a standalone unit that records your podcasts directly to a microSD card. So, you can use it on the road as well. The portability is a great plus!

**Reasons Why You Need to Avoid:**

Even though Rode calls the RodeCaster Pro "the perfect all-in-one podcasting solution," there are still some reasons why you might need to avoid it.

**● Price Tag**

First and foremost, its price tag of $430 is something to look at. However, if you are not into the podcasting business for the long run, then investing in a $430 mixer is not worth it.

**● No Camera Connection**

Other than that, you can't connect it to a camera. So, if you want to create video podcasts, this mixer won't benefit you.

### 2\. [Behringer Xenyx Q802USB](https://www.amazon.com/Behringer-Q802USB-Premium-8-Input-Preamps/dp/B084RC1TSQ/ref=sr%5F1%5F2?crid=31X0FCNOK7CX5&keywords=behringer+xenyx+q802usb&qid=1666936481&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIzLjQyIiwicXNhIjoiMy4wMCIsInFzcCI6IjIuNTUifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=%2Caps%2C283&sr=8-2)

If you are looking for a mixer that can handle your podcasting needs for less than $100, Behringer Xenyx Q802USB is a great choice. It is a premium-quality audio mixer and offers a range of advanced mixing functions.

![behringer xenyx q802usb and its cables](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/10-best-mixers-for-podcasting-in-2022-5.jpg)

It has four channels, with the first two offering XLR mic inputs and the other two offering stereo inputs. Each channel has a separate equalizer. So, for solo or 2-person podcasts, this is your go-to mixer.

Moreover, the Behringer Q802USB is an analog audio mixer with a USB interface. The unit comes with a copy of free audio recording Tracktion software. With Tracktion, you get your digital audio workstation. All you have to do is make a simple USB connection.

**What You'll Love:**

The Q802USB has some unique features you will surely love.

**● One Knob Compression**

The cool part about Behringer Q802USB is its "one-knob compression." Unfortunately, applying compression is a delicate art that many podcasters struggle with. But with its one-knob compression, the Behringer Xenyx Q802USB saves you a lot of time and energy.

The compression knob is available on all mono channels. So you can easily dial in the perfect amount of compressions and create precise audio mixes.

**● FX Send**

Another feature that makes this mixer interesting is the FX Send output.

This feature allows you to add an external effects processor, which you can use to add finishing touches or create unique sounds.

**Reasons Why You Need to Avoid:**

 Some reasons you might consider not buying the Behringer Q802USB are its build quality, lack of a power switch, and such.

**● Build Quality**

With low prices come some compromises. The Behringer Xenyx Q802USB saves its cost on the built quality. Made of plain plastic and aluminum, this mixer is not very sturdy and might not last long enough.

Some users have complained that the mixer sometimes wobbles on a flat surface which could be irritating during recording.

**● No On/Off Switch**

Another reason that could be a deal breaker is that it has no power on/off button. It can be annoying as you have to unplug the mixer whenever you want to turn it off.

### 3\. [PreSonus StudioLive AR8c](https://www.amazon.com/PreSonus-StudioLive-AR8c-8-Channel-Performance/dp/B081BCJDKQ/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?keywords=PreSonus%2BStudioLive%2BAR8c%2B8-Channel%2BUSB-C%2BHybrid%2BDigital%2FAnalog%2BPerformance%2BMixer&qid=1667017849&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIwLjQ4IiwicXNhIjoiMC4wMCIsInFzcCI6IjAuMDAifQ%3D%3D&sr=8-1&th=1)

PreSonus came into the market with an upgrade with its StudioLive AR8c. It is easy to operate and has a logical and compact workflow, as each button has a single function. The exciting bit is that with this mixer, you get the best of both worlds with its analog controls and digital interface.

![preSonus studioLive ar8c audio mixer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/10-best-mixers-for-podcasting-in-2022-6.jpg)

The AR8c has around 8 channel inputs divided into 4 mic inputs, 2 instrument/line inputs, and 2 stereo inputs. The 4 mic inputs have XMAX mic preamps which give plenty of headroom and clarity of sound.

Not only that, but the AR8c also has a feature called the "Stereo Super Channel." Connecting external devices such as your phone has Bluetooth, RCA inputs, and 1/8-inch stereo input. In addition, this mixer has a USB-C connection as well as a built-in SD card. So, depending upon your need, you can use it separately or connect with a computer.

**What You'll Love:**

The PreSonus StudioLive AR8c is a great find with some really cool specs that will give you something to think about.

**● Digital Effects**

The AR8c has up to 16 digital effects, allowing you to liven up your podcast. Different effects make your podcasts sound more intriguing and unique.

**● Saving Channel Presets**

This one also allows you to save your channel presets. It saves you the hassle of adjusting your settings every time you start recording.

**● Stereo Super Channel**

The super stereo channel is something to love in the PreSonus AR8c. In addition, the Bluetooth connectivity and other inputs offer a lot of room to play around with external devices as you work on your podcast.

**Reasons Why You Need to Avoid:**

Although AR8c has many great features, there are still some things that might change your mind about buying this mixer.

**● Bulky Unit**

If you are looking for something compact and small, then Ar8c is not up your alley. The design is a bit bulky and takes up some space.

Thus, it can be a dealbreaker if you don't have enough space.

**● No Faders**

One of the primary reasons for avoiding this mixer is that it has no faders. Instead of faders, it does offer the mixer knobs, but they are not as accurate as the faders.

### 4\. [Zoom PodTrak P4](https://www.amazon.com/Zoom-Digital-Multitrack-Recorder-P4/dp/B08F8HL7T7)

The Zoom PodTrak P4 is the reigning kind of field recorder. It was released in 2020, but this gadget mixed up the mixer world. The PodTrak P4 does everything a mixer does but in a more flexible packaging. So you can call it a handheld podcast recorder.

![the zoom podtrak p4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/10-best-mixers-for-podcasting-in-2022-7.jpg)

This podcast recorder has four XLR microphone inputs which can help in multitrack recording. Each input has a gain control and a mute button. It also has 4 headphone outputs with independent volume controls. It also has 4 sound pads which you use to enhance your podcast while recording.

**What You'll Love:**

A bit of an overview of the features has surely attracted you to the PodTrak P4, but we saved the best for last.

**● Reasonable Price**

The Zoom PodTrak P4, despite its many features and compact form, is priced at only $200\. It provides almost all RodeCaster Pro's features but comes at almost half its price.

With its convenient design and reasonable price, the Zoom PodTrak P4 is a great catch!

**● Separate Headphone Control**

As a podcaster, you often need to control the participants' headphone volume levels. Lucky for you that even with such a compact build, PodTrak P4 allows you to adjust the volume levels of each headphone.

**Reasons Why You Need to Avoid:**

Like all things, PodTrak P4 also has some cons.

**● Plastic Build**

The Zoom PodTrak P4 has a plastic build. Unfortunately, this means that it might not be long-lasting and is most likely prone to damage. However, the plastic built is not much of a dealbreaker at such a low price.

**● Not Standalone**

While we are on the subject of dealbreakers, PodTrak P4 is not a standalone unit. It would help if you had at least one XLR mic to record your podcast. So, in terms of portability, you require a mic along with the PodTrak.

### 5\. [Yamaha AG03](https://www.amazon.com/Yamaha-AG03-DJ-Mixer/dp/B00ST0FOO0/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?keywords=yamaha+ag03&qid=1667026985&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIyLjMyIiwicXNhIjoiMS41OCIsInFzcCI6IjEuMjIifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=Yamaha+Ag0%2Caps%2C435&sr=8-1) & [Yamaha AG06](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TY8JFSC/ref=as%5Fli%5Fqf%5Fsp%5Fasin%5Fil%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00TY8JFSC&linkCode=as2&tag=djosdes-20&linkId=JDZC3J3A3NI6DJYZ&th=1)

Now, we will be looking at Yamaha AG03 and Yamaha AG06\. We are talking about both these mixers together because they essentially have the same basic functions.

Apart from the fact that AG03 is a 3-channel mixer and AG06 is a 6-channel mixer, there is little difference in the way they work.

![close-up of yamaha ag03 and ag06](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/10-best-mixers-for-podcasting-in-2022-8.jpg)

These mixers have battery support and are powered by a USB source. They also provide easy control over compression, equalization, and the SPX reverb effect. The AG03 has a single mic input, and the AG06 has two mic inputs. Concerning their price tags, the AG03 costs around $149, whereas the AG06 costs around $199.

**What You'll Love:**

Yamaha AG03 and AG06 have some really good points you will enjoy while using them.

**● Compact design**

The Yamaha AG03 and AG06 have a very compact design containing pretty cool features. This design comes in handy while traveling.

**● Custom Compression and EQ**

Another fun feature of these two mixers is that you can customize the compression and equalization settings in each one of the XLR mic inputs.

**● Control of Computer Audio**

If you connect the mixer to your computer, the mixer offers you control of the computer sound. For example, using the mixer's own input level knob, you can use to adjust the volume of the sound coming from the computer.

### Reasons Why You Need to Avoid

Some contest points regarding these two Yamaha mixers are the value of money they offer and the lack of a muting option for an individual channel.

**● Value of Money**

As compared to other mixers, AG03 and AG06 offer fewer features in a higher price range. As a result, they do not provide you with good value for your money.

So, why not get something better for the same price?

**● Lack of Muting Options for Individual Channel**

Yamaha AG03 and AG06 do not offer a mute button for individual channels. So, if you have to mute a channel that is not in use, you have to turn down the gain. Although just as effective as the mute button, it is a bit tedious.

### 6\. [Pyle-Pro PAD10MXU](https://www.amazon.com/Pyle-2-Channel-Audio-Mixer-Professional/dp/B003CY6OHY/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?crid=1NUBF26NW64E&keywords=pyle-pro+pad10mxu&qid=1667050077&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIwLjc0IiwicXNhIjoiMC4wMCIsInFzcCI6IjAuMDAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=Pyle-Pro+PAD10MXU%2Caps%2C638&sr=8-1)

Most of the mixers on the list come at a high price. However, Pyle-Pro PAD10MXU is a relatively cheap mixer with minimalistic features that will fulfill your podcasting needs.

PAD10MXU is a 2-channel mixer with a USB interface. The first channel features an XLR and ¼ inch phone connection. You can connect a mic, line device, or any other instrument using Channel 1.

![pad10mxu controls and interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/10-best-mixers-for-podcasting-in-2022-9.jpg)

Channel 2/3 is an RCA input that you can use to connect record/playback devices. You also have gain controls for both channels for level adjustment. The Pyle-Pro PAD10MXU comes for $68, the cheapest on our list.

**What You'll Love:**

Apart from its low cost, certain features of the PAD10MXU are undoubtedly attractive.

**● Low Noise Design**

The PAD10MXU has a low-noise design with a 2-channel input and a single output through headphones. The line 2/3 input has a select switch set, and the channel 1 gain has a peak LED light indicator. It is convenient as it is simple to use and saves you a lot of hassle.

**● Independent Controls**

The independent controls of each input give you more freedom to experiment. Especially the master control lets you hear everything that is being recorded by the mixer. You can adjust the level of the overall mixer using the master control knob.

**Reasons You Need to Avoid:**

You might want to avoid the Pyle-Pro PAD10MXU because of its low phantom power and lack of signal tracking.

**● Low Phantom Power**

Compared to other mixers with 48V phantom power, this mixer only caters to 18V. That could be a drawback for someone who wants to work with greater phantom power.

**● No Signal Tracking**

If you want to use an instrument with a track to record live, this mixer is not for you. The reason is that PAD10MXU cannot track your signal.

### 7\. [Alesis MultiMix 4](https://www.amazon.com/Alesis-MultiMix-Four-Channel-Integrated-Effects/dp/B00IPF9DX2/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?crid=1QAPQTJQI1MTC&keywords=Alesis+MultiMix+4&qid=1667085211&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIxLjE5IiwicXNhIjoiMC44NyIsInFzcCI6IjAuNDMifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=alesis+multimix+4%2Caps%2C756&sr=8-1)

The Alesis MultiMix 4 is another banger on the list of best mixers. The interface is easy to use and has good functionality.

![alesis multimix 4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/10-best-mixers-for-podcasting-in-2022-10.jpg)

Alesis MultiMix 4 is a 4-channel mixer. All of these inputs can accept a ¼ inch line input. In addition, you can plug in XLR or condenser microphones (thanks to the 48V phantom power). You can also add a guitar or bass to the mix.

Besides that, Alesis MultiMix 4 also comes with cool built-in effects such as reverb, delays, phasers, and much more. You can add extra depth to your audio using these effects.

**What You'll Love:**

The MultiMix 4 has valuable features that will make you consider buying this mixer.

**● Portable**

The compact and easily operatable design gives this mixer great portability.

**● High Pass Filtering**

Channel 1 and channel 2 of the mixer provide phenomenal high pass filtering at 75Hz to reduce wind noise or low-frequency rumbling.

**Reasons Why You Need to Avoid:**

This mixer serves pretty well for podcasting; however, there is one reason why you might not like it.

**● No Individual Recordings of Inputs**

When you transfer or save your recording on the computer, the mixer does not provide individual recordings of each input. Instead, you get only a single recording of the main output.

### 8\. [Behringer Xenyx Q1202USB](https://www.amazon.com/Behringer-Q1202USB-12-Channel-Mixer/dp/B008O517IW)

The Behringer Xenyx Q1202USB provides state-of-the-art features for you to record stunning, professional podcasts. If you are a bit more on the professional end of the podcasting game, then this is the mixer for you.

![behringer xenyx q1202usb](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/10-best-mixers-for-podcasting-in-2022-11.jpg)

The Q1202USB is a 12-channel mixer with 4 XLR mic inputs, multiple line inputs, and a few RCA inputs. It also has an FX send for you to add any external processors. This mixer offers great control over the different channel inputs. You can adjust the gains, EQ, pan, and much more using the control knobs.

**What You'll Love:**

The Behringer Xenyx Q1202USB has many features to offer, but out of them, the following two are our favorite, and hopefully, you'll like them too.

**● Cost Effective**

The Behringer Xenyx Q1202USB is a cost-effective audio mixer. Having a price tag of $110, it offers all the features that mixers in the $200 or $400 category offer.

So, if you're looking for something cheap with many features, this mixer is the one.

**● Gain Control**

Apart from price, this mixer will provide you great gain control over your microphone inputs. So, if you want more control over your audio while recording podcasts, go to Amazon and get shopping.

**Reasons Why You Need to Avoid:**

Although the Q1202USB has great features to offer. However, some major flaws come with it.

**● Less Control with Computer Playback**

One of the major flaws is that this mixer does not allow you to monitor your input while also hearing the computer playback. As a result, it is incredibly annoying if you want to record your computer playback, as the mic can not be muted.

**● Audio Wiggles at Lower Gain Settings**

Another flaw is that you tend to hear audio wiggles if your gain settings are lower than 75%. Again, these can be a turn-off for you but not that much of a significant flaw.

### 9\. [Mackie PROFX12V2](https://www.amazon.com/Mackie-PROFX12V2-12-Channel-Compact-Effects/dp/B00VUU7B7E)

Moving on, we have the Mackie PROFX12V2\. It is a high-quality analog mixer and has a user-friendly interface. It is perfect for professional podcasting.

![mackie profx12v2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/10-best-mixers-for-podcasting-in-2022-12.jpg)

PROFX12V2 has a total of 12-channels, seven of which offer Onyx preamps. It comes with a USB-B port and also has ports for headphones. It also has great effects, such as reverb, delays, echo, etc.

**What You'll Love:**

The Mackie PROFX12V2 does get some cool points for its amazing equalizer and built-in USB interface.

**● Equalizer**

The PROFX12V2 has a 7-band graphic equalizer that helps adjust your audio signal's balance. You can boost or cut specific frequencies and get your desired audio sound.

**● Built-in USB Interface**

The built-in USB interface of PROFX12V2 allows you to record the show while simultaneously providing music playback. It is great for adding background music to your podcasts.

**Reasons Why You Need to Avoid:**

Although Mackie PROFX12V2 is a great choice for podcasts, there are some reasons why you might avoid it.

**● Not in Stock**

You might notice that this mixer is a bit old, so you might not see it available in a pin pack on sites such as Amazon.

**● Compression**

The compression feature of the PROFX12V2 is not that great and might change your mind about buying this mixer.

### 10\. [Allen & Heath ZEDi-8](https://www.amazon.com/Allen-Heath-ZEDi-8-Compact-Interface/dp/B01A2YQ9BM)

Last on the list is the Allen & Heath ZEDi-8\. This one is a compact hybrid mixer that gives high-level audio results for your podcast.

The ZEDi-8 has a new preamp design. Mike Griffin created it in his highly acclaimed GS-R24 studio. The preamps are called GSPre and deliver low noise and massive headroom.

**Reasons Why You Need to Avoid:**

**● Learning Curve**

As compared to other mixers, this one has a bit of a stiff learning curve. So, for beginners, this one might be a bit difficult to get accustomed to.

Okay! So, now that you know about the 10 best mixers available for podcasting. If you still can't decide, you can consider the following aspects while buying an audio mixer.

## Part 4\. What should I look for when buying an Audio Mixer?

Buying an audio mixer is a difficult decision to make. Because if you are not fully aware of your requirement, you might pick the wrong one and end up regretting later. So, to save you from regrets, we are going to tell you what you should look for while buying one.

### Channel Count

The first thing you need to know is how many people you will be having in your podcasts. Then, depending on the number of people contributing to your podcast, you must choose a mixer that meets that number of channels.

### Connection Types

You also need to know whether your guests or cohosts will join you via a mic or phone connection. While buying a mixer, make sure they have the right number of connection types you require

### Analog or Digital

While analog mixers are cheaper, digital ones are more functional. So, analog is better for you if you have a tight budget. However, digital mixers are more fun to play with if you get some money.

### Cost

Some mixers do not offer good value for money. So, make sure you do proper research before buying a mixer. Look and compare the features and prices of different mixers to choose one which is the most cost-effective for you.

With these considerations, you may clearly mind choosing an audio mixer to a close.

Part 1\. Do I Need an Audio Mixer for Podcasting?

The question that you must be asking yourself is, "Do I even need a mixer for podcasting?' Well, the answer is simple. You don't necessarily need a lemon squeezer, but it helps extract all the juice quickly. Likewise, audio mixers are unnecessary, but they make your job easy.

Using an audio mixer for podcasts improves the audio quality, and the preamps will be nicer. A mixer will also give you more control and options to play around with. But the best part is that it saves you a lot of time in post-production.

If you use an audio mixer to its full potential, you might even be able to record the complete podcast in one flow and avoid post-production altogether. Now that you understand the need for a mixer let us look at the editors' favorite podcast mixers.

## Part 2\. Editor's Favorite Mixers for Podcasting

Based on the features and functionality of podcast mixers, some editors have rated the following three podcast mixers as their favorites.

Furthermore, it can work in isolation and save and store audio on the microSD card. Therefore, it is best suited for recording live podcasts and integrating remote guests.

The Rode RodeCaster Pro, priced at $430, is a complete game-changer if you are into podcasting for the long haul.

### 2\. [Behringer Xenyx Q802USB](https://www.amazon.com/Behringer-Q802USB-Premium-8-Input-Preamps/dp/B084RC1TSQ)

Next on the list is the Behringer Xenyx Q802USB, another top-notch mixer that editors recommend. It is a USB interface mixer connecting your computer with a USB cable. It is not a sole unit but works with different instruments.

![behringer xenyx q802usb](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/10-best-mixers-for-podcasting-in-2022-2.jpg)

It has 2 XLR microphone inputs, 2 stereo inputs, and multiple audio outputs. Moreover, the preamps are pretty good (go up to 60 DB) too. This audio mixer will step up your podcasting gear game. The Behringer Xenyx Q802USB costs around $95 and is your ticket to great sound quality.

### 3\. [PreSonus StudioLive AR8c](https://www.amazon.com/PreSonus-StudioLive-AR8c-8-Channel-Performance/dp/B081BCJDKQ)

Last but not least is the PreSonus StudioLive AR8c. AR8c is a great fit for anyone who wants to upgrade from a simple two-channel interface.

Similar to the previous two recommendations, this also gives great sound quality. You also get more control over your recording process.

![presonus studiolive ar8c](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/10-best-mixers-for-podcasting-in-2022-3.jpg)

We have given you an overview of the top three picks of editors but let us go into a bit more detail about the top 10 best mixers for podcasting.

## Part 3\. The 10 Best Mixers for Podcasting in 2022

If you are looking for a mixer with a complete set of podcast functions within your price range, here is a list of the 10 best podcasting mixers. These 10 mixers vary in their features and prices. Thus, giving you a ton of variety to choose from. So, let's get started.

### 1\. [Rode RodeCaster Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Rode-RODECaster-Podcast-Production-Studio/dp/B07M5LQ1YZ/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?keywords=rode+rodecaster+pro&qid=1666871235&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI0LjMyIiwicXNhIjoiMy41NiIsInFzcCI6IjIuNDkifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=Rode+Rod%2Caps%2C453&sr=8-1)

The Rode RodeCaster Pro is one of the few mixers explicitly designed for podcasts. As a result, it is one of the greatest mixers available in the market. All you need is a good mic to use with it, and you are on your way to creating a fantastic podcast.

![the rode rodecaster pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/10-best-mixers-for-podcasting-in-2022-4.jpg)

The RodeCaster Pro is a digital mixer that works best for multi-person podcasts. It helps record up to four people locally and bring in a remote or telephonic guest. In addition, the simplicity of the RodeCaster Pro is exceptional such that you can even carry it around with you and record podcasts on the go.

With this mixer, you can record on separate channels, which gives you a lot of flexibility in post-production. It also gives you more control over individual microphones.

**What You'll Love:**

The RodeCaster Pro offers a wide variety of features to you.

**● Four Mic Inputs**

With its four microphone inputs and a smartphone, USB, and Bluetooth channels, you can talk to up to five people simultaneously.

**● Eight Programmable SoundBoards**

Apart from that, it has eight programmable soundboards. You can customize these soundboards and add sound clips you will need during your podcast.

**● microSD card Storage**

Lastly, one of the best parts is that it is a standalone unit that records your podcasts directly to a microSD card. So, you can use it on the road as well. The portability is a great plus!

**Reasons Why You Need to Avoid:**

Even though Rode calls the RodeCaster Pro "the perfect all-in-one podcasting solution," there are still some reasons why you might need to avoid it.

**● Price Tag**

First and foremost, its price tag of $430 is something to look at. However, if you are not into the podcasting business for the long run, then investing in a $430 mixer is not worth it.

**● No Camera Connection**

Other than that, you can't connect it to a camera. So, if you want to create video podcasts, this mixer won't benefit you.

### 2\. [Behringer Xenyx Q802USB](https://www.amazon.com/Behringer-Q802USB-Premium-8-Input-Preamps/dp/B084RC1TSQ/ref=sr%5F1%5F2?crid=31X0FCNOK7CX5&keywords=behringer+xenyx+q802usb&qid=1666936481&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIzLjQyIiwicXNhIjoiMy4wMCIsInFzcCI6IjIuNTUifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=%2Caps%2C283&sr=8-2)

If you are looking for a mixer that can handle your podcasting needs for less than $100, Behringer Xenyx Q802USB is a great choice. It is a premium-quality audio mixer and offers a range of advanced mixing functions.

![behringer xenyx q802usb and its cables](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/10-best-mixers-for-podcasting-in-2022-5.jpg)

It has four channels, with the first two offering XLR mic inputs and the other two offering stereo inputs. Each channel has a separate equalizer. So, for solo or 2-person podcasts, this is your go-to mixer.

Moreover, the Behringer Q802USB is an analog audio mixer with a USB interface. The unit comes with a copy of free audio recording Tracktion software. With Tracktion, you get your digital audio workstation. All you have to do is make a simple USB connection.

**What You'll Love:**

The Q802USB has some unique features you will surely love.

**● One Knob Compression**

The cool part about Behringer Q802USB is its "one-knob compression." Unfortunately, applying compression is a delicate art that many podcasters struggle with. But with its one-knob compression, the Behringer Xenyx Q802USB saves you a lot of time and energy.

The compression knob is available on all mono channels. So you can easily dial in the perfect amount of compressions and create precise audio mixes.

**● FX Send**

Another feature that makes this mixer interesting is the FX Send output.

This feature allows you to add an external effects processor, which you can use to add finishing touches or create unique sounds.

**Reasons Why You Need to Avoid:**

 Some reasons you might consider not buying the Behringer Q802USB are its build quality, lack of a power switch, and such.

**● Build Quality**

With low prices come some compromises. The Behringer Xenyx Q802USB saves its cost on the built quality. Made of plain plastic and aluminum, this mixer is not very sturdy and might not last long enough.

Some users have complained that the mixer sometimes wobbles on a flat surface which could be irritating during recording.

**● No On/Off Switch**

Another reason that could be a deal breaker is that it has no power on/off button. It can be annoying as you have to unplug the mixer whenever you want to turn it off.

### 3\. [PreSonus StudioLive AR8c](https://www.amazon.com/PreSonus-StudioLive-AR8c-8-Channel-Performance/dp/B081BCJDKQ/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?keywords=PreSonus%2BStudioLive%2BAR8c%2B8-Channel%2BUSB-C%2BHybrid%2BDigital%2FAnalog%2BPerformance%2BMixer&qid=1667017849&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIwLjQ4IiwicXNhIjoiMC4wMCIsInFzcCI6IjAuMDAifQ%3D%3D&sr=8-1&th=1)

PreSonus came into the market with an upgrade with its StudioLive AR8c. It is easy to operate and has a logical and compact workflow, as each button has a single function. The exciting bit is that with this mixer, you get the best of both worlds with its analog controls and digital interface.

![preSonus studioLive ar8c audio mixer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/10-best-mixers-for-podcasting-in-2022-6.jpg)

The AR8c has around 8 channel inputs divided into 4 mic inputs, 2 instrument/line inputs, and 2 stereo inputs. The 4 mic inputs have XMAX mic preamps which give plenty of headroom and clarity of sound.

Not only that, but the AR8c also has a feature called the "Stereo Super Channel." Connecting external devices such as your phone has Bluetooth, RCA inputs, and 1/8-inch stereo input. In addition, this mixer has a USB-C connection as well as a built-in SD card. So, depending upon your need, you can use it separately or connect with a computer.

**What You'll Love:**

The PreSonus StudioLive AR8c is a great find with some really cool specs that will give you something to think about.

**● Digital Effects**

The AR8c has up to 16 digital effects, allowing you to liven up your podcast. Different effects make your podcasts sound more intriguing and unique.

**● Saving Channel Presets**

This one also allows you to save your channel presets. It saves you the hassle of adjusting your settings every time you start recording.

**● Stereo Super Channel**

The super stereo channel is something to love in the PreSonus AR8c. In addition, the Bluetooth connectivity and other inputs offer a lot of room to play around with external devices as you work on your podcast.

**Reasons Why You Need to Avoid:**

Although AR8c has many great features, there are still some things that might change your mind about buying this mixer.

**● Bulky Unit**

If you are looking for something compact and small, then Ar8c is not up your alley. The design is a bit bulky and takes up some space.

Thus, it can be a dealbreaker if you don't have enough space.

**● No Faders**

One of the primary reasons for avoiding this mixer is that it has no faders. Instead of faders, it does offer the mixer knobs, but they are not as accurate as the faders.

### 4\. [Zoom PodTrak P4](https://www.amazon.com/Zoom-Digital-Multitrack-Recorder-P4/dp/B08F8HL7T7)

The Zoom PodTrak P4 is the reigning kind of field recorder. It was released in 2020, but this gadget mixed up the mixer world. The PodTrak P4 does everything a mixer does but in a more flexible packaging. So you can call it a handheld podcast recorder.

![the zoom podtrak p4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/10-best-mixers-for-podcasting-in-2022-7.jpg)

This podcast recorder has four XLR microphone inputs which can help in multitrack recording. Each input has a gain control and a mute button. It also has 4 headphone outputs with independent volume controls. It also has 4 sound pads which you use to enhance your podcast while recording.

**What You'll Love:**

A bit of an overview of the features has surely attracted you to the PodTrak P4, but we saved the best for last.

**● Reasonable Price**

The Zoom PodTrak P4, despite its many features and compact form, is priced at only $200\. It provides almost all RodeCaster Pro's features but comes at almost half its price.

With its convenient design and reasonable price, the Zoom PodTrak P4 is a great catch!

**● Separate Headphone Control**

As a podcaster, you often need to control the participants' headphone volume levels. Lucky for you that even with such a compact build, PodTrak P4 allows you to adjust the volume levels of each headphone.

**Reasons Why You Need to Avoid:**

Like all things, PodTrak P4 also has some cons.

**● Plastic Build**

The Zoom PodTrak P4 has a plastic build. Unfortunately, this means that it might not be long-lasting and is most likely prone to damage. However, the plastic built is not much of a dealbreaker at such a low price.

**● Not Standalone**

While we are on the subject of dealbreakers, PodTrak P4 is not a standalone unit. It would help if you had at least one XLR mic to record your podcast. So, in terms of portability, you require a mic along with the PodTrak.

### 5\. [Yamaha AG03](https://www.amazon.com/Yamaha-AG03-DJ-Mixer/dp/B00ST0FOO0/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?keywords=yamaha+ag03&qid=1667026985&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIyLjMyIiwicXNhIjoiMS41OCIsInFzcCI6IjEuMjIifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=Yamaha+Ag0%2Caps%2C435&sr=8-1) & [Yamaha AG06](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TY8JFSC/ref=as%5Fli%5Fqf%5Fsp%5Fasin%5Fil%5Ftl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00TY8JFSC&linkCode=as2&tag=djosdes-20&linkId=JDZC3J3A3NI6DJYZ&th=1)

Now, we will be looking at Yamaha AG03 and Yamaha AG06\. We are talking about both these mixers together because they essentially have the same basic functions.

Apart from the fact that AG03 is a 3-channel mixer and AG06 is a 6-channel mixer, there is little difference in the way they work.

![close-up of yamaha ag03 and ag06](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/10-best-mixers-for-podcasting-in-2022-8.jpg)

These mixers have battery support and are powered by a USB source. They also provide easy control over compression, equalization, and the SPX reverb effect. The AG03 has a single mic input, and the AG06 has two mic inputs. Concerning their price tags, the AG03 costs around $149, whereas the AG06 costs around $199.

**What You'll Love:**

Yamaha AG03 and AG06 have some really good points you will enjoy while using them.

**● Compact design**

The Yamaha AG03 and AG06 have a very compact design containing pretty cool features. This design comes in handy while traveling.

**● Custom Compression and EQ**

Another fun feature of these two mixers is that you can customize the compression and equalization settings in each one of the XLR mic inputs.

**● Control of Computer Audio**

If you connect the mixer to your computer, the mixer offers you control of the computer sound. For example, using the mixer's own input level knob, you can use to adjust the volume of the sound coming from the computer.

### Reasons Why You Need to Avoid

Some contest points regarding these two Yamaha mixers are the value of money they offer and the lack of a muting option for an individual channel.

**● Value of Money**

As compared to other mixers, AG03 and AG06 offer fewer features in a higher price range. As a result, they do not provide you with good value for your money.

So, why not get something better for the same price?

**● Lack of Muting Options for Individual Channel**

Yamaha AG03 and AG06 do not offer a mute button for individual channels. So, if you have to mute a channel that is not in use, you have to turn down the gain. Although just as effective as the mute button, it is a bit tedious.

### 6\. [Pyle-Pro PAD10MXU](https://www.amazon.com/Pyle-2-Channel-Audio-Mixer-Professional/dp/B003CY6OHY/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?crid=1NUBF26NW64E&keywords=pyle-pro+pad10mxu&qid=1667050077&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIwLjc0IiwicXNhIjoiMC4wMCIsInFzcCI6IjAuMDAifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=Pyle-Pro+PAD10MXU%2Caps%2C638&sr=8-1)

Most of the mixers on the list come at a high price. However, Pyle-Pro PAD10MXU is a relatively cheap mixer with minimalistic features that will fulfill your podcasting needs.

PAD10MXU is a 2-channel mixer with a USB interface. The first channel features an XLR and ¼ inch phone connection. You can connect a mic, line device, or any other instrument using Channel 1.

![pad10mxu controls and interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/10-best-mixers-for-podcasting-in-2022-9.jpg)

Channel 2/3 is an RCA input that you can use to connect record/playback devices. You also have gain controls for both channels for level adjustment. The Pyle-Pro PAD10MXU comes for $68, the cheapest on our list.

**What You'll Love:**

Apart from its low cost, certain features of the PAD10MXU are undoubtedly attractive.

**● Low Noise Design**

The PAD10MXU has a low-noise design with a 2-channel input and a single output through headphones. The line 2/3 input has a select switch set, and the channel 1 gain has a peak LED light indicator. It is convenient as it is simple to use and saves you a lot of hassle.

**● Independent Controls**

The independent controls of each input give you more freedom to experiment. Especially the master control lets you hear everything that is being recorded by the mixer. You can adjust the level of the overall mixer using the master control knob.

**Reasons You Need to Avoid:**

You might want to avoid the Pyle-Pro PAD10MXU because of its low phantom power and lack of signal tracking.

**● Low Phantom Power**

Compared to other mixers with 48V phantom power, this mixer only caters to 18V. That could be a drawback for someone who wants to work with greater phantom power.

**● No Signal Tracking**

If you want to use an instrument with a track to record live, this mixer is not for you. The reason is that PAD10MXU cannot track your signal.

### 7\. [Alesis MultiMix 4](https://www.amazon.com/Alesis-MultiMix-Four-Channel-Integrated-Effects/dp/B00IPF9DX2/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?crid=1QAPQTJQI1MTC&keywords=Alesis+MultiMix+4&qid=1667085211&qu=eyJxc2MiOiIxLjE5IiwicXNhIjoiMC44NyIsInFzcCI6IjAuNDMifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=alesis+multimix+4%2Caps%2C756&sr=8-1)

The Alesis MultiMix 4 is another banger on the list of best mixers. The interface is easy to use and has good functionality.

![alesis multimix 4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/10-best-mixers-for-podcasting-in-2022-10.jpg)

Alesis MultiMix 4 is a 4-channel mixer. All of these inputs can accept a ¼ inch line input. In addition, you can plug in XLR or condenser microphones (thanks to the 48V phantom power). You can also add a guitar or bass to the mix.

Besides that, Alesis MultiMix 4 also comes with cool built-in effects such as reverb, delays, phasers, and much more. You can add extra depth to your audio using these effects.

**What You'll Love:**

The MultiMix 4 has valuable features that will make you consider buying this mixer.

**● Portable**

The compact and easily operatable design gives this mixer great portability.

**● High Pass Filtering**

Channel 1 and channel 2 of the mixer provide phenomenal high pass filtering at 75Hz to reduce wind noise or low-frequency rumbling.

**Reasons Why You Need to Avoid:**

This mixer serves pretty well for podcasting; however, there is one reason why you might not like it.

**● No Individual Recordings of Inputs**

When you transfer or save your recording on the computer, the mixer does not provide individual recordings of each input. Instead, you get only a single recording of the main output.

### 8\. [Behringer Xenyx Q1202USB](https://www.amazon.com/Behringer-Q1202USB-12-Channel-Mixer/dp/B008O517IW)

The Behringer Xenyx Q1202USB provides state-of-the-art features for you to record stunning, professional podcasts. If you are a bit more on the professional end of the podcasting game, then this is the mixer for you.

![behringer xenyx q1202usb](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/10-best-mixers-for-podcasting-in-2022-11.jpg)

The Q1202USB is a 12-channel mixer with 4 XLR mic inputs, multiple line inputs, and a few RCA inputs. It also has an FX send for you to add any external processors. This mixer offers great control over the different channel inputs. You can adjust the gains, EQ, pan, and much more using the control knobs.

**What You'll Love:**

The Behringer Xenyx Q1202USB has many features to offer, but out of them, the following two are our favorite, and hopefully, you'll like them too.

**● Cost Effective**

The Behringer Xenyx Q1202USB is a cost-effective audio mixer. Having a price tag of $110, it offers all the features that mixers in the $200 or $400 category offer.

So, if you're looking for something cheap with many features, this mixer is the one.

**● Gain Control**

Apart from price, this mixer will provide you great gain control over your microphone inputs. So, if you want more control over your audio while recording podcasts, go to Amazon and get shopping.

**Reasons Why You Need to Avoid:**

Although the Q1202USB has great features to offer. However, some major flaws come with it.

**● Less Control with Computer Playback**

One of the major flaws is that this mixer does not allow you to monitor your input while also hearing the computer playback. As a result, it is incredibly annoying if you want to record your computer playback, as the mic can not be muted.

**● Audio Wiggles at Lower Gain Settings**

Another flaw is that you tend to hear audio wiggles if your gain settings are lower than 75%. Again, these can be a turn-off for you but not that much of a significant flaw.

Okay! So, now that you know about the 10 best mixers available for podcasting. If you still can't decide, you can consider the following aspects while buying an audio mixer.

## Part 4\. What should I look for when buying an Audio Mixer?

Buying an audio mixer is a difficult decision to make. Because if you are not fully aware of your requirement, you might pick the wrong one and end up regretting later. So, to save you from regrets, we are going to tell you what you should look for while buying one.

### Channel Count

The first thing you need to know is how many people you will be having in your podcasts. Then, depending on the number of people contributing to your podcast, you must choose a mixer that meets that number of channels.

### Connection Types

You also need to know whether your guests or cohosts will join you via a mic or phone connection. While buying a mixer, make sure they have the right number of connection types you require

### Analog or Digital

While analog mixers are cheaper, digital ones are more functional. So, analog is better for you if you have a tight budget. However, digital mixers are more fun to play with if you get some money.

### Cost

Some mixers do not offer good value for money. So, make sure you do proper research before buying a mixer. Look and compare the features and prices of different mixers to choose one which is the most cost-effective for you.

With these considerations, you may clearly mind choosing an audio mixer to a close.
