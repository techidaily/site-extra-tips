### 1\. A Smartphone

It's entirely conceivable to wander into the metaverse with your iOS or Android gadget. You can get stages like Roblox after downloading its app at no cost. Others like Axie Boundlessness are available through Android, even though they're not accessible on the iPhone.

### 2\. A computer

### 3\. A gaming console

### 4\. Augmented Reality (AR) glasses
