#### Installing games on Windows 10

Here you will see Lara Croft in Siberia. Also there is ‘Minecraft’ (Mojang) with new features and a reboot of the 90s Killer Instinct. Gears of War: Ultimate Edition is a remake of the original with improved graphics and Dolby surround sound 7.1 while Wasteland 2 is a sequel to their 25 year-old game and is a post-apocalyptic RPG that promises over 80,000 of game-time. Some other popular games that will be available are Fable Legends, Sea of Thieves, Shovel Knight, Pinball FX2, Candy Crush Saga etc.

Any game that has an Xbox logo on it means that it also offers Xbox Live achievements and is synced with you Xbox Live profile. Microsoft is not accepting games from developers without a rating so you can have a look at the rating before you buy a game that is appropriate for you. At the bottom of the page you will also get information about how big the game is and on what devices it will run. The quality of games at the Windows 10 store could pose a challenge for Steam some say!
