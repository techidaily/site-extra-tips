## First-hand review for DJI Spark

#### 1\.  Unboxing

 Although, the appearance of Spark didn't change a lot compared to [DJI Mavic Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), its tiny size and sharp color also gave us a fresh and new feeling.

###### #1\. Storage Box

 The same old foam box as used by Phantom series and [Inspire 2](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) drones is going to protect your DJI Spark. It is lightweight too. You can easily pack it inside your travelling bag because the overall weight of this box goes only up to 500 grams where 95grams is the battery weight and 300grams is weight of your tiny aircraft. This is simply the best drone to have fun in a picnic with friends because it will not add extra bourdon to your luggage.

 Spark is perfect combination of technologies that makes its flights more stunning. It is equipped with 3D sensing system, high precision type inertial measurement mechanism, dual band GPS, Vision Positioning System, 24 powerful core for enhanced computing and many more. Spark use to follow its owner in air, and it's incredibly advanced design technology let it behave like an intelligent unit. It understands your gestures and move accordingly. The most impressive one is that when you outstretch your palm, it comes down and sits on your palm. That's really amazing.

###### #2\. Control Mode

 You will be able to enjoy three different control modes with DJI Spark, they are:

* Gesture

 In this mode, you don't need phone or controller to control the drone, it can take off and land in your hand, keep following you when you waving your palm in front of its camera. You make a rectangle in air using your fingers and your intelligent drone will capture a selfie for you. But note that, this feature works only up to 3 meters distance.

![gesture mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gesture-mode.gif)

* By App on Smartphone

 You can switch between 4 different shooting modes as below with DJI Go app on your phone:

**Rocket:** It makes camera to point downward.

**Dronie:** Lock your drone camera focus on single subject and then move upward or downward to grab details.

**Circle:** Move in circular fashion around a fixed target.

**Helix:** Helix like performance around subject.

* By Remote Controller

![spark remote comtroller](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/spark-remote-comtroller.jpg)

 Under this mode, the Spark's flight potential will be totally liberated. After connecting the remote controller, the WIFI technology allows for 720p real-time video transmission from up to 2 km away, and the flight speed can reach up to 50km/h. What's more, you can pick up the latest [DJI Goggles](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to see a different world.

###### #2\. Camera

 A key feature of Spark is the camera. It equiped with a 2-axis mechanical gimbal, and can captures 12 MP photos as well as stabilized 1080p 30fps video footage.
