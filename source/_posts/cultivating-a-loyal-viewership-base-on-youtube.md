As a content creator the first struggle to create a YouTube channel is on how to grow your subscriber. You can get YouTube subscriber by creating a video. This is also the hardest part of monetizing a channel. Unless the content is deeply satisfying, viewers watch dozens of videos without ever hitting subscriber.

But how you will get these thousand subscribers if you are a beginner.

### YouTube Collab To Other Content Creator

Because collaboration benefits everyone, working with influencer is a great way to get in front of potential subscriber to your channel. Try to reach out to similar users in your field and ask them out for an opportunity to work together on something interesting. Creator put a lot of work into video collaborations. They search for likeminded partners, brainstorm collab ideas, and film several videos together. But after all that work, the two creators get a priceless reward sharing their audiences. Doing research who to work with before deciding to collab some content creator will help you match with partners where you have a higher chance of gaining interested and engaged followers. Video collabs are a vital way to get YouTube subscribers, no matter the size of your channel

### YouTube Keywords, thumbnail and video Titles

YouTube keywords are the foundations of any great channel, and they're the best way to get traffic as a new creator. Adding relevant terms to your tittles and video description will help your content climb search result fast. Don't make the tittle too long and make your title be descriptive as to give your audience a sneak peek as to what the video all about. Create a custom human thumbnail because your video thumbnails are essentially the cover of your video, so you need it to be absolutely beyond engaging. Using annotations and relevant images as custom thumbnail for your YouTube videos will increases your videos click through rate. Thumbnail help you attract new users to your channel and if you are not designing catchy thumbnail you are missing out a lot.

### Produce a High-Quality Video

Pay attention particularly to the lightning, audio and editing of your videos. These days there's no need to drop and amount of money to buy an expensive camera as long as you have your smart phone or whatever cameras you have that you will used to shoot a video. When you have thought of good content next step is how to enhance the video, so you must need to learn on how to make your video editing catchy.

For recommendation i personally used [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) as my video editor software, very easy to use especially when you are just starting out in video editing.

### Promote your Channel

One of the quickest ways to attract new subscriber is through other social media platform where you already have an audience. Posting in a community tab is an easy way to promote your channel. This social media network is inside of YouTube itself, and you can use it to share text, images and videos. Never stop promoting your videos in all your social media platform. Some creators don't have a problem getting subscribers. They actually have consistency, which hinders them from posting enough content. And growing their audience. You don't have to post daily or even three days a week to grow on YouTube. But you have to be consistent and maintain a regular posting schedule to keep people subscribed to your channel. As the saying goes Consistency is the Key, make a schedule on posting a video, be consistent on promoting your video on your social media platform. I assure you that will give you a big help on growing your YouTube subscriber.
