### **4\. Video Color Adjustment**

You can adjust the color of your video using advanced color correction presets available in Filmora. The platform features a number of pre-made templates for this purpose, including vignettes, film looks, and 3D LUT effects. Similarly, you can even save any custom color settings to apply to your videos according to the project’s requirements.

The process to use it is quite simple, as you need to double-click the color preset you want to use. Next, it will be applied automatically, and you can check what the video looks like.

Here are some other color adjustment parts you can use:

* **Exposure:** Adjusting this can make your video brighter or darker. A negative value darkens the colors, while a positive value lightens them. It's great for fixing images that are too bright or too dark.
* **Brightness:** Simply controls the overall brightness of your video.
* **Contrast:** This slider lets you fine-tune the contrast between light and dark areas in your video. Pushing it one way makes dark areas darker and light areas lighter while going the other way does the opposite.
* **Saturation:** Increasing this slider intensifies the colors in your video while reducing it makes the colors less vibrant and can even make the image look a bit gray.
* **Vibrance:** Use this to make the less intense colors pop without over saturating the already vivid ones, which is helpful for keeping skin tones looking natural.

In the Light panel, you can enhance the lighting in your video by adjusting Highlights, Shadows, Whites, and Blacks. To make changes, slide the respective sliders from left to right.

**HSL (Hue, Saturation, Luminance):** HSL stands for Hue, Saturation, and Luminance. This part lets you fine-tune specific color ranges in your video. Select the color you want to adjust from the color panel and use the sliders for Hue, Saturation, and Luminance to modify only that chosen color.

* **Hue:** You can fine-tune the color's shade (like moving from lime green to teal) in your video. For example, change a blue sky and all blue objects to shades between cyan and purple.
* **Saturation:** This adjusts how vivid the color appears. For instance, you can turn a faded blue sky into a highly saturated, vibrant one.
* **Luminance:** Control the brightness of the color range you've selected.

## **Conclusion**

The GoPro Max 360 and GoPro Hero 11 serve different videography needs. The GoPro Max 360 offers 360-degree capabilities, ideal for creative and immersive panoramic footage. It's a top choice for experimenting with unique perspectives and features unbreakable stabilization. Conversely, the GoPro Hero 11 excels in traditional action shooting, delivering high-quality, stable video content with its 5.3K resolution and 10-bit color.

Your choice between the two depends on your preference for 360-degree versatility or exceptional traditional action camera performance. Both cameras offer impressive features, but it's crucial to prioritize the one that best aligns with your specific filming requirements.

### **4\. Video Color Adjustment**

You can adjust the color of your video using advanced color correction presets available in Filmora. The platform features a number of pre-made templates for this purpose, including vignettes, film looks, and 3D LUT effects. Similarly, you can even save any custom color settings to apply to your videos according to the project’s requirements.

The process to use it is quite simple, as you need to double-click the color preset you want to use. Next, it will be applied automatically, and you can check what the video looks like.

Here are some other color adjustment parts you can use:

* **Exposure:** Adjusting this can make your video brighter or darker. A negative value darkens the colors, while a positive value lightens them. It's great for fixing images that are too bright or too dark.
* **Brightness:** Simply controls the overall brightness of your video.
* **Contrast:** This slider lets you fine-tune the contrast between light and dark areas in your video. Pushing it one way makes dark areas darker and light areas lighter while going the other way does the opposite.
* **Saturation:** Increasing this slider intensifies the colors in your video while reducing it makes the colors less vibrant and can even make the image look a bit gray.
* **Vibrance:** Use this to make the less intense colors pop without over saturating the already vivid ones, which is helpful for keeping skin tones looking natural.

In the Light panel, you can enhance the lighting in your video by adjusting Highlights, Shadows, Whites, and Blacks. To make changes, slide the respective sliders from left to right.

**HSL (Hue, Saturation, Luminance):** HSL stands for Hue, Saturation, and Luminance. This part lets you fine-tune specific color ranges in your video. Select the color you want to adjust from the color panel and use the sliders for Hue, Saturation, and Luminance to modify only that chosen color.

* **Hue:** You can fine-tune the color's shade (like moving from lime green to teal) in your video. For example, change a blue sky and all blue objects to shades between cyan and purple.
* **Saturation:** This adjusts how vivid the color appears. For instance, you can turn a faded blue sky into a highly saturated, vibrant one.
* **Luminance:** Control the brightness of the color range you've selected.
