* [Part 1: Why Need Photo Grid App?](#part1)
* [Part 2: Top 10 Photo Grid Apps: For Web, iOS, and Android](#part2)

## Part 1: Why Need Photo Grid App?

Let’s say you have a couple of photos that you wish to combine as a single collage. Now, if you do it manually, then it will consume a lot of time and you won’t get a polished product.

That’s why you can consider using a photo grid editor that presents a wide range of readily available layouts and collage templates. You can just select any preferred photo grid collage maker and upload your photos to the layout. The photo grid app would present your images in a visually appealing way and would also let you add texts, stickers, filters, and so much more.
