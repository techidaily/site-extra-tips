## Assessing the Full Video Range Within a 64/128GB Memory Pool

Memory cards and storage devices come in many sizes, just as grocery store bags come in various sizes for transporting customers' food, and each user will choose which size to purchase. Each user will consider various criteria while making this decision, including the size of the videos they intend to save on the SD card.

## How much video can 64GB hold?

Based on the normal video resolution of 4k at 60fps, a 64GB storage device can keep more than 1 hour and 20 minutes of video time.

A 64GB storage device can hold more than 1 hour and 37 minutes of video at a resolution of 2.7k at 120fps. On a 64GB memory card, recording at a resolution of 1080p at 60fps allows for around 5 hours of video time.

## How much video can 128GB hold?

A 128GB memory card may carry about 75 or 76 videos if each film is only 3 minutes long.

The data rate of movies is generally influenced by the format and codec of the videos. When this happens, the time it takes for a memory card of that capacity to fill up can be affected. A normal 128GB memory card should be able to hold up to 24 hours of video at 1080p HD. That data rate must be 8.85MB/s for this to happen.

A normal 128GB memory card should be able to hold up to 24 hours of footage at 1080p at 4k resolution. That data rate must be 8.85MB/s for this to happen. A standard 128GB memory card can hold up to 48 hours of film at 720p at 4k resolution. A data rate of roughly 4.42MB/s is also required.
