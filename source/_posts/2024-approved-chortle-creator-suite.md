There are plenty of categorized meme templates available in this web app and you also get a search bar for searching the trendy meme template. And if you want to edit your meme and post it on any social media, then Imgur is the best choice. You can follow these steps to create a meme with Imgur online:

* First, open the official website of Imgur, and then in the website interface, you will see the option to create a new post.

Most of the amazing features from Filmora come with a paid subscription. However, it is also available for a free trial for users who want to access it on the go.

![imgur alternative for computer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/add-titles-win-2.png)

* To make a video meme with the help of Filmora, first, go to the application interface. Now, click on the "+" sign to add media files to your project.
* Then select the video file or video meme template that you want to edit. Now, [Filmora]( https://filmora.wondershare.com/video-editor/) will import it to its interface. You can either select one single file from your camera roll. You can also add multiple images or videos to make a meme.
* Now after the video files are loaded into the interface, add on the "Effects" tab and then select "Texts" to add text to your meme video. Drag the timeline to the bottom of your screen to place the text where you want it to start. You can also pan or zoom the text available on your preview window. This is to adjust its placement on the final video.
* After you are done with the text editing for your meme video, you can add music and voice effects through the "Effects" option and then select "Music" from the available tools.
* After you are done with all the editing, click on the "export to device". The video will be saved to your memory drives in a few moments. Then you can share your meme to any social media handles that you prefer.
