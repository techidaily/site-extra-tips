### Step4 Extracting Audio from Video

There are two beneficial ways so we can extract audio from an input video file. You can achieve this by removing raw audio (without re-encoding it), or by re-encoding it.

A file not preceded by the -i command line switch is treated as an output file in FFmpeg commands. This software uses as many inputs and outputs as you provide. You can also specify the output file name using the –y command.

### Step5 Extracting an Audio Out of a Video File Without Re-encoding

`ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -acodec`

You can understand this part as removing only the video and leaving the audio. You can use the -vn command line flag to remove the video, then copy the audio file from the source to the destined folder without re-encoding it using the -acodec copy command line. Let's have a look at the below-mentioned command to understand.

If you executed the command utility, you could notice that your extracted audio file is under the name **audio.acc**, as we specified in the proceeding command ls

**Output**

`video.mp4`

It also allows you to use the -map flag to select all audio streams or a specific part of the audio.

### Step4 Extracting Audio from Video

There are two beneficial ways so we can extract audio from an input video file. You can achieve this by removing raw audio (without re-encoding it), or by re-encoding it.

A file not preceded by the -i command line switch is treated as an output file in FFmpeg commands. This software uses as many inputs and outputs as you provide. You can also specify the output file name using the –y command.

### Step5 Extracting an Audio Out of a Video File Without Re-encoding

`ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -vn -acodec`

You can understand this part as removing only the video and leaving the audio. You can use the -vn command line flag to remove the video, then copy the audio file from the source to the destined folder without re-encoding it using the -acodec copy command line. Let's have a look at the below-mentioned command to understand.

If you executed the command utility, you could notice that your extracted audio file is under the name **audio.acc**, as we specified in the proceeding command ls

**Output**

`video.mp4`

It also allows you to use the -map flag to select all audio streams or a specific part of the audio.
