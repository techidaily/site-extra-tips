### 1\. Pure color background

You can choose any clean and solid color wall, curtain, or wallpaper as a background for your live stream. But make sure that it is neat enough and has a broad field of vision. Moreover, there is no exposure to it.

It will be best to choose one that can easily match any color. But remember, do not use pure white backgrounds as they are too reflective, which is not suitable for the vision of your stream as it affects the highlight of the streamer and the products very much.

### 2\. Neatly organized shelves

Another way is to choose well-organized and clean shelves as a background. For example, you can set a bookshelf as your background if you have to join some live business meetings or academic sessions.

Even if you are a seller showcasing his products during a live stream, you can select this type of background by placing the products you will introduce on any clean shelf. It will help you to make the viewer experience much better.

### 4\. Virtual backgrounds

This is the best option for gamers and technology streamers. Using this feature, you can change your background anytime with any beautiful wallpaper or image you want. They can give your viewers a better visual appearance and a trustful impression. That is why live streams are also very important for large businesses.

Also, there are two kinds of virtual backgrounds. The first is a static image in which you can directly upload the wallpaper you want. The second option is the green screen, which is preferable to the latter. Because it allows you to use much more appealing and awesome backgrounds in your stream, as well as more accurate image matting.
