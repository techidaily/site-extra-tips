## Boosting Facebook Video Performance

Facebook is a treasure trove of memories for a lot of people. Users with Facebook profiles use it as an identifier for other sites, seeing and sharing their videos and images, and much more. For some users, the video they post may not have the right video speed and want to change it. For example, if the length of the video is too long or the main person presenting the video is a slow speaker.

Unfortunately, there is no preset setting on Facebook to increase the playback speed. So, **can you speed up Facebook videos** still?

The answer is yes, mainly with the help of other tools. In this article, let's discuss the **Facebook video speed controller** options and how to carry out the process. Learn the step-by-step procedure and methods to carry it out on various device types here.

However, it would be best to use third-party software like Filmora after downloading the video separately for superior-quality video speed changes. There are multiple speed settings, and each one is easy to use.
