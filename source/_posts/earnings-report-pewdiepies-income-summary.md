We have studied the channel and its content and found many other factors that attribute to the channel’s popularity. Check them out below.

As can be seen from the videos, the man behind PewDiePie has a charming and exclusive personality. Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg is funny, crazy, and entertaining which makes him popular not only among the young audience but people of all age groups.

**3\. Perfect Niche and interesting topics**

For any channel to be a hit, the content plays a major role and PewDiePie clearly knows what the audience wants. The channel from his early days picks up the relevant topics that have also seen growth over the years. Having a niche in gaming content, there is no competition yet for PewDiePie.

**4\. Regular uploading of video**

Another important factor that makes PewDiePie popular is its regular video upload that keeps the subscribers interested and looking forward to the next one.

In addition to the above, entrepreneurial mind-set, eye-catchy content and visuals, and appreciation towards the fan are some of the many other reasons accounting for the success and popularity of PewDiePie.

**Most Famous videos of PewDiePie on YouTube**

PewDiePie has uploaded multiple gaming and other comic content videos that are popular among viewers. Still, if we look at all of them, there are a few which are all-time-hit and most popular ones. Below is the list that we have made for the same.
