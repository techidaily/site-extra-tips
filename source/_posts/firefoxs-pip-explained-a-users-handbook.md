## Firefox's PIP Explained: A User's Handbook

Using your PC to watch films while working on something else has recently been possible due to the new picture-in-picture mode function. Mozilla Firefox users may utilize this functionality to accomplish two or more things simultaneously.

This feature is an important tool to help you multitask by dragging videos from web pages and navigating to another tab so you can continue working on other tabs while the video keeps playing. In this article, you will understand everything about this feature and how to enable this feature.

## Part 1\. How Picture-in-Picture Mode Works

Picture-in-Picture allows for simple tab navigation without interfering with the video you are viewing. Enabling this feature allows your videos to play in a tiny overlay utilizing a separate video player. Users may move, resize and even pin the player on the screen. You may even switch between tabs without interfering with video playing.

The interface has a play/pause button. You may also recover a video by locating it as well as close the interface by clicking the close button if you wish to. It will return to the initial tab and continue from where it left off when the player was closed.

When your video is in picture-in-picture mode, the video placeholder also displays on the website. "This video is playing in Picture-in-Picture mode," it reads.

Using keyboard shortcuts, you can make adjustments for loudness but not for the video quality. However, you may make these adjustments from the original web page of the film. Also, keep in mind that any modifications to its initial position will affect the floating player. The video will immediately disappear when you refresh or open a new website in that tab.

## Part 2\. How to activate Picture-in-Picture (PiP) in Firefox

Firefox is often considered one of the most data-protective browsers, but that is not all. Mozilla Firefox also comes with a variety of useful tools and features. It even incorporates certain features you can only find through extensions in other browsers.

Firefox, like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and other current browsers, supports picture-in-picture mode. This functionality allows you to view movies in a floating window while working with other tabs, browsers, desktop apps, and so on.

Because this picture-in-picture panel is an overlay, you may move it to any part of your screen. So, in picture-in-picture mode, you may click play/pause, shut it, or expand it to its full size.

### Step-by-step Guide to Enable Firefox Picture-in-Picture Mode

Without the assistance of third-party add-on modules, PiP mode is a feasible choice. The picture-in-picture (PiP) mode option in the Firefox browser is activated by default. However, if this does not work, you can easily re-enable the option in the Firefox browser's Settings area.

Here's how to activate picture-in-picture video control in Firefox**:**

1. **To start**, locate and open the Firefox browser on your PC.
2. Click on the 3 horizontal lines in the top-right menu.
3. Choose the **Options/Settings** from the menu list. This opens the settings mode and its general model.

![choose the options/settings]( https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/the-firefox-picture-in-picture-mode-2.jpg)

1. Scroll down in the General mode to locate the **Browsing** settings option.
2. Here, you will see a list of browsing settings; click to select the '**Enable picture in picture video controls'**, and check the box.

![a list of browsing settings]( https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/the-firefox-picture-in-picture-mode-3.jpg)

Following the above procedure, you may now see the Firefox Picture-in-Picture symbol in the video streaming player. Whenever you visit a streaming site, a symbol for pip mode appears as an overlay on the video screen.

![the firefox picture in picture symbol]( https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/the-firefox-picture-in-picture-mode-4.jpg)

You can load only a single video using the above guideline. Suppose you want to lunch multiple videos to increase your multitasking experience. In that case, follow the outlined procedure:

1. Open any website with video in Firefox web browser.
2. When the video start. Move the cursor over the video to reveal the Picture-in-Picture logo.
3. Picture-in-Picture mode is activated by tapping the logo. The video is repositioned to the side of the web page.
4. Repeat the preceding steps on the same page or in a separate tab to open several movies.
5. Firefox plays the new video above the first. Drag and drop it anywhere to display both.

![the new video above the first]( https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/the-firefox-picture-in-picture-mode-5.jpg)

By following these steps, videos appear on the screen at the same time. For all tabs containing open videos, the main Firefox window shows a "play" symbol. Even if you dismiss Firefox, numerous videos will continue to play in other programs or on your desktop.

## Part 3\. How to Disable the Picture-in-Picture Mode

Sometimes, the PiP mode can disturb necessary research or task that needs your full concentration. In this scenario, disabling the Picture-in-Picture mode is a way to get your task done with the optimum attention. If you want to turn off Picture-in-Picture mode and return to the video tab, hover over the video, then click the following icon **“X”**.

## Part 4\. Other tips about Picture-in-Picture Mode in Firefox

### 4.1 Picture-in-Picture extension in Firefox

Another mode of having your picture-in-picture mode on Firefox is using the available add-on features. You can access several add-on extensions available on Firefox by tapping the **Menu** button. Locate the [add-on menu item](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/) and click it. Once it loads, you can use the search bar at the top right corner to select your preferred picture-in-picture add-on.

### 4.2 Keyboard shortcuts about Picture-in-Picture in Firefox

It is also possible to enable and disable the picture-in-picture mode using keyboard shortcuts. To get this done, use the key combination of **'Ctrl + Shift + \]'**. By simultaneously holding these keys, Firefox will launch the relevant video on the web page into a picture-in-picture mode. However, if the feature has been enabled before pressing the key combination, it automatically disables the feature.
