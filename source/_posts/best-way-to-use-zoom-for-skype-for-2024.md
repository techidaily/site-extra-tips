## Part 3\. Related FAQs

### Does Zoom work with Skype?

You may now zoom inside of Skype. Although it may be hard to read, we're not referring to a competing application.

### Is Skype Zoom free?

The 2013 debut of the cloud-based video conferencing application has witnessed a significant surge in use.

Links can be used again in the future.

### How do I open Skype Zoom?
