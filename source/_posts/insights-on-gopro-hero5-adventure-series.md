This is simply the best device at reasonable price range and the video as well as image quality is amazing. The cube shape of this device is really attractive with tiny body that you can carry anywhere with ease. It is time to order your Hero5 session device online and soon you will be able to record your all adventurous trips with awesome capture quality. The waterproof and damage proof construction is itself an edge over all competing devices.
