Digital painting may easily become the most dominant art form in the future since more and more artists are producing their art in the digital format. The widespread and accessibility of drawing apps for Windows also contributes to the popularity of digital painting.

However, such diversity of software products that can be used for drawing or painting may be confusing especially for someone who is just getting started. What’s more, the tools a drawing app offers can limit the scope of your options and ultimately lower the quality of your artwork.

We combed the Internet in search of best free and paid drawing apps for Windows and we’ve shortlisted those that have to offer the most to both skilled and unskilled users.

## Top 10 Drawing Apps for Windows

The purpose for which you will be using a drawing app is often the best guideline to follow while choosing a software you intend to use to create digital paintings and drawings since there isn’t much sense in spending a lot of money on a software product that offers advanced features you will never use.

Here’s what drawing apps for Windows have to offer.

In addition, you can choose from a huge selection of paints and brushes to create highly detailed images.

### 4. [PAINT.NET](https://www.getpaint.net/)

What’s more, Clip Studio Paint grants you access to a broad range of tools that make the painting process quicker and easier. You can choose between less expensive Clip Studio Paint Pro and pricier Clip Studio Paint EX versions of the app.
