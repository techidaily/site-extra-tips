## What does SRT, SSA, XML, etc., look like?

### 1\. SRT

First, there’s a section for subtitle number, which is followed by the time at which the subtitle appears and ends. Then comes the subtitle that will appear.

### 2\. SSA

It is a plain text file that is composed of three sections, Script Info, Styles, and Events.
