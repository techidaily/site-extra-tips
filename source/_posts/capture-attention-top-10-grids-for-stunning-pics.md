Do you have a couple of photos that you wish to combine and merge as a single collage or a grid? Well, if your answer is yes, and you are looking for the best photo grid app, then you have come to the right place.

* [Part 1: Why Need Photo Grid App?](#part1)
* [Part 2: Top 10 Photo Grid Apps: For Web, iOS, and Android](#part2)

## Part 1: Why Need Photo Grid App?

Let’s say you have a couple of photos that you wish to combine as a single collage. Now, if you do it manually, then it will consume a lot of time and you won’t get a polished product.

That’s why you can consider using a photo grid editor that presents a wide range of readily available layouts and collage templates. You can just select any preferred photo grid collage maker and upload your photos to the layout. The photo grid app would present your images in a visually appealing way and would also let you add texts, stickers, filters, and so much more.

### Conclusion

I’m sure that after going through this guide, you can pick the best photo grid app to meet your requirements. As you can see, I have come up with all kinds of photo grid makers here that you can use online or on your smartphone. Ideally, if you have basic requirements, then using an online photo grid editor would be a quick solution. Though, if you want to use a photo grid app on your smartphone, then you can simply go with apps like PicCollage, Frames, and MOLDIV. Apart from these photo grid apps, there are several other options for iOS, Android, and web that you can further explore to create stunning collages.
