Fortunately, you can now convert Live Photo to video with the launch of iOS13\. You can create small videos out of your Live Photos and retain sound and motion. Plus, you can share the videos anywhere you wish without restrictions.

In this post, we will learn how to turn a Live Photo to video using some easy ways.
