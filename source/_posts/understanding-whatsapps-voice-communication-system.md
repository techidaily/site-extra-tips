### How to send the voice message on iOS or Android

The steps of recording and sending a voice message using WhatsApp are nearly identical on iOS and Android devices. So both iOS and Android users can follow up on these steps:

1. Press and hold the voice recorder button on the right side to record the voice message. However, a more effective way is to swipe up the voice recorder button to lock it. Now you can easily record it without holding the button.
2. There are three more options appear at the bottom:

* **The Delete button** can used to delete the voice you've just recorded. However, if you haven't locked the recorder button, you can delete the message by sliding it to the left.
* **The pause button** can help you in pausing the recording.
* **The send button** will send your recorded voice message.

1. Before sending, you can also check your recorded voice by clicking the pause button, and then you have the option to play the voice.
