## Part 2\. 5 good book trailer examples

These are some examples of the best book trailers. You can have a look at them to understand them better.

### Invisible Official Series trailer

What makes this one more impressive is its animation with perfect narration and effects. These make it more attractive for the readers.

### Lev Grossman's The Magician's Land

This one has another unique idea. The author has taken reviews from some influential personalities and fans to introduce the story and concept of the book. This type of book trailer also helps in catching a large number of readers.

### Impyrium by Henry H. Neff

It has a good animation with narration and great sound and editing effects. Moreover, the narrator's tone is exciting and seems to be a well-structured book trailer.

### Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children

Its idea is also unique and good. The trailer starts with a grandfather narrating the story to his grandson. Another excellent example of exciting narration too.

### Gods & Monsters by Shelby Mahurin

A short book trailer with story narration and some critical points of synopsis. This is also a good and quick book trailer example.

## Part 3\. Ideas for a book trailer

Here are some great ideas to make your book trailer more outstanding.

### 1\. Introduce the Synopsis

You can excitingly introduce the book's synopsis to attract the readers. Try to take the combination of reality and fiction. The so-called virtual mainly refers to the omission of those secondary plot and characters to give the audience imagination and foreshadowing to cause the audience's expectations and illusions, thereby increasing the audience's suspense. The term "real" primarily refers to the central theme of the original movie, the protagonists, and significant elements of the particular performance.

### 2\. Keep it short

A short book trailer is more viewed than a longer one. So, always try to make your book trailer quick.

### 3\. Narrate the story

It is one of the best ideas to narrate the story as it will make the trailer more interesting to watch. Remember to maintain some suspense if the book you are presenting is a novel. Give a brief summary of the plot to encourage readers to keep reading to discover the solution.

### 4\. Well structure

A good book trailer should be well structured and follow a concise and exciting frame structure. In fact, it is comparable to standard movie trailers in that its primary purpose is to advertise a work to draw viewers to it or to introduce the viewer to the author's creative concept or background. For creation, you can therefore also take inspiration from the typical format of movie trailers.

## Part 4\. How to make a book trailer by using Filmora?
