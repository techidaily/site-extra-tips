In terms of productivity and engagement prospects, Meet significantly outperforms chat applications like Google Hangouts, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Viber, and Telegram, among others. Using the screen-sharing tool, for instance, participants may view a document, spreadsheet, presentation, or browser tab. Reading little writing on your Google Meet may be simpler if you zoom in. For instance, zooming in may assist you view tiny text if you're reading a document on your Google Meeting that you are unable to alter.

Joining a meeting is as simple as clicking or tapping a link. For macOS, Windows, iOS, Android, and iPad OS, the platform is also accessible as a web app.

## Part 2\. How to zoom in/out Google Meet

The simplest way to do it in Google Meet is by clicking or tapping to zoom in. When everyone is present in a room, the Google Meet camera will automatically zoom in. From the camera, it is impossible to zoom in on certain speakers. Zoom out after you're finished. When done, choose Done or Return to home by tapping or clicking.

**Steps to Zoom in/out in Google Meet:**

Step1 Set up a video conferencing setup and start a conference in your web browser with your administrator. The configurations you wish to modify such as Camera: for this option, choose the camera device of your choice as shown here:

## Part 3\. Tips and tricks to use Google Meet

Those who have a Google Account are able to start a meeting. It's simple to make one if you don't already have one. Especially if you have a Gmail account, you undoubtedly already have one. The sooner you learn how to use them, the sooner you'll be an expert on Meet calls. Google has numerous handy keyboard shortcuts built in, including a keyboard shortcut to display you all of the keyboard shortcuts. Start using these methods without ever taking your eyes off your camera if you truly want to wow your colleagues on your next Google Meet conversation.

* By testing your audio inputs and outputs before you join a conversation using Google Meet's virtual green room function, you may save yourself a lot of humiliation and save your coworkers some annoyance.
* You don't need to worry about having your eyes crossed if you're on a really busy conversation and can't exactly concentrate on where the main speaker is in your grid or tile view. To maintain your attention on the primary speaker without straining your eyes, all you have to do is pin them to the top row of your grid.
* Google Meet has you covered whether you want to record a meeting for posterity, share a copy of it with coworkers who couldn't make it, or refer to it afterwards. All you have to do to start recording meetings is choose that option from the three-dot menu at the bottom of the screen.
* Numerous individuals are often present during Google Meet calls. You should turn on the grid or tile layout if you want to be sure to see them all, or at least as many as you can. Simply choose the Tiled option from the three-dot menu at the bottom of the screen. You may then use the slider in the pop-out window to show 6 to 49 more participants.
* If you are the call's owner, you may turn off everyone else's microphone by placing your mouse over the volume symbol and selecting Silence.
* For added convenience, Google Meet lets you cast a meeting to another screen. The TV in your living room or conference room may be projected from your laptop or desktop, in other words.
* Similar to the subtitle feature seen on other applications like Skype, this feature allows you to have the dialogue show in text on your screen in real-time so that you can more easily understand what is being said during video chats. It is exclusively offered in English. Click Turn on Captions in the Meet's bottom right corner to turn it on.
* Users of Google Meet will be able to pin many individuals to the top of their tiled screen. This will be especially useful if you have meetings where two or three people talk the majority of the time.

## Conclusion

You may just need to zoom in or out on a Google Meet momentarily. You can rapidly get your screen back to its original perspective after zooming in or out.
