## Part 1\. 5 ways to overlay photos online

### 1\. [Online Image Editor](https://www.online-image-editor.com/)

Online Image Editor is a free online tool that makes the image overlay operation easy to do. Moreover, this website does not put any limit on the number of images or photos to be superimposed, even if the only way to do it is to overlap them one at a time, and not altogether. In practice, Online Image Editor works literally in layers, with the next image that overlaps with the previous one, and so on. To underline the fact that the images should not necessarily be superimposed, but also juxtaposed to one another on the same background, or rotated, or with various background effects such as shadows.

![online image editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/overlay-photos-on-computer-or-online-1.jpg)

Pros

* The user interface is simple and friendly with numerous editing features
* Images can be crafted in an excellent manner
* Optimum and consistent performance is assured
* Fotor offers a one-tap enhancement tool that spontaneously touches up normal images

Cons

* Many distractive ads keep showing up
* Special image editing background is required
* Effects cannot be tweaked with Fotor
* The font sizes cannot be changed in an independent manner
* In the free version, many features and functionalities have been disabled

### 2\. [LunaPic](https://www2.lunapic.com/editor/)

LunaPic is another free site to superimpose images online. As in the previous case, you can overlay multiple photos, but only one by one, using tools such as transparency control, the various effects of shade, and course the rotation. In addition, you can upload photos not only from your PC but also from social networks like Facebook or simply from Google Images. The main flaw, of Online Image Editor, is the impossibility of canceling the overlap of the first images: you can only delete the last one you added.

![lunapic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/overlay-photos-on-computer-or-online-2.jpg)

### 3\. [IMGonline](https://www.imgonline.com.ua/eng/)

IMGonline is a free platform very useful to superimpose images: while presenting the same limitations as previous sites, this platform has the merit of maintaining much of the quality of the photos, even in the case of PNG files. Also on this site, there are various transparency and shadow effects and, despite having the same defects as the others, it is more immediate and quicker to use.

![imgonline](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/overlay-photos-on-computer-or-online-3.jpg)

* The primary website of Ribbet lacks definitive or distinguishing features

### 4\. [PicMonkey](https://www.picmonkey.com/)

Even PicMonkey is an online editor that performs its duty, and it does so with simplicity and by following the standards of the other sites seen in our list. One of its major strengths is the drag & drop option and the ability to resize images simply by clicking with the mouse cursor on the corners. But the real gem of PicMonkey is another: unlike its competitors, this site will allow you to edit any image already overlaid, if you have not already merged. Finally, being an editor, you can also edit images with various effects.

![picmonkey](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/overlay-photos-on-computer-or-online-4.jpg)

Pros

* Many artistic elements that are cool and easy to use are available

### 5\. [Phixr](http://www.phixr.com/photo/uploadtool)

Phixr is an excellent alternative to the sites seen previously: unlike the others, it allows you to upload multiple images in one shot, but you can't overlay them at the same time. As usual, you can change the transparency level, the shadows, the size, and the rotation. Unfortunately, every action you do will be irreversible, so this could bring you a lot of frustration: for this reason, our advice is to use it especially if you need to quickly overlay multiple images, without paying too much attention to the result.

![phixr](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/overlay-photos-on-computer-or-online-5.jpg)

Pros

* Advanced range of image editing tools is available under one roof
* Stellar performance can be achieved through different complexity levels
* The interface is interactive and easy to work around
* Offers editing features available in advanced software versions

Cons

* Sometimes, special image editing background is needed to work with
* The images can be resized using complex function
* Downloads have to be periodically done in an extensive manner

### 5\. [Phixr](http://www.phixr.com/photo/uploadtool)

Phixr is an excellent alternative to the sites seen previously: unlike the others, it allows you to upload multiple images in one shot, but you can't overlay them at the same time. As usual, you can change the transparency level, the shadows, the size, and the rotation. Unfortunately, every action you do will be irreversible, so this could bring you a lot of frustration: for this reason, our advice is to use it especially if you need to quickly overlay multiple images, without paying too much attention to the result.

Pros

* Advanced range of image editing tools is available under one roof
* Stellar performance can be achieved through different complexity levels
* The interface is interactive and easy to work around
* Offers editing features available in advanced software versions

* Sometimes, special image editing background is needed to work with
* The images can be resized using complex function
* Downloads have to be periodically done in an extensive manner
