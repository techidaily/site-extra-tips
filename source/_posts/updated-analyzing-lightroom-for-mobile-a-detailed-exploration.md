## Part 4\. Advantages and Disadvantages Of Lightroom App For Android

The Lightroom app for Android has a variety of features that can be useful for both amateur and professional photographers. However, the app also has drawbacks that you should be aware of before you download it.

**Advantages:** Lightroom is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, even for those who are not familiar with photo editing software, and offers a wide range of editing tools such as color correction preset, preset filter effects, crop, details, optics, masking, and healing. Moreover, an Auto (preset color correction) tool is also added, which can help you fix your picture automatically.

The Lightroom app offers cloud support and a picture library that keeps your data in sync between your devices to help you access it anywhere, anytime. The app also provides an extensive export feature that allows you to set file type, quality, and dimension before saving the picture on your device.

**Disadvantages:** Lightroom does not support printing or plugins. You can't print your photos directly from the app, nor can you use plugins to add extra features. The app doesn't have layer-based editing. Therefore, you can't make complex edits to your photos on the go.

Furthermore, the sharing feature is limited and does not allow you to share your picture directly with the Adobe Discover photo-sharing community.

**Note:**   _Despite these drawbacks, Lightroom is still an excellent option for Android users looking for a powerful photo editor. However, if you want an alternative to the **Lightroom app, use [Pixiz](https://pixiz.en.uptodown.com/android) \- a free personalized photo editing app.**_
