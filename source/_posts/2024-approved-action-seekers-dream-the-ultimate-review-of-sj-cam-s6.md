#### Video Quality

SJCam has added its best efforts to offer all good features within one tiny action camera unit. But the biggest fact to discuss about its video quality is the interpolated 4K offering. In order to update your knowledge about this technology, let us mention that interpolated word expresses the ability to update lower resolution levels with richer pixel density using some advanced processing techniques internally. It means, SJ6 Lengend can itself record 2K videos only but the end results are 4K with added 2K pixels. But, you will be able to adjust with this feature as SJ6 Legend offers incredible results at its 240 fps and 120 fps adjustments at 720p resolution level and the super capacity results at 1080p.

This action camera offers great footage results in day light; however, you may find little decay in quality at low light conditions. You may find little trouble with its low audio quality but overall service is appreciable.

You will find great color distribution in all SJ6 Legend camera photos with added sharpness in details. Every picture delivers great information but once you enlarge the view or take it out in full size you will notice blurriness in view. Users report impressive results in day light but performance naturally goes down with low light conditions. One more trouble with its 16MP lens resolution is that with long hour usage you may start facing camera freezing issues.

Even if you start recording videos at a road full of bumps, simply switch to your powerful gyro stabilizer and you will get fine details for whole footage.

#### Video Quality

#### Video Quality

SJCam has added its best efforts to offer all good features within one tiny action camera unit. But the biggest fact to discuss about its video quality is the interpolated 4K offering. In order to update your knowledge about this technology, let us mention that interpolated word expresses the ability to update lower resolution levels with richer pixel density using some advanced processing techniques internally. It means, SJ6 Lengend can itself record 2K videos only but the end results are 4K with added 2K pixels. But, you will be able to adjust with this feature as SJ6 Legend offers incredible results at its 240 fps and 120 fps adjustments at 720p resolution level and the super capacity results at 1080p.

Every picture delivers great information but once you enlarge the view or take it out in full size you will notice blurriness in view. Users report impressive results in day light but performance naturally goes down with low light conditions. One more trouble with its 16MP lens resolution is that with long hour usage you may start facing camera freezing issues.

#### Image Stabilization and Fisheye Correction

#### Video Quality

SJCam has added its best efforts to offer all good features within one tiny action camera unit. But the biggest fact to discuss about its video quality is the interpolated 4K offering. In order to update your knowledge about this technology, let us mention that interpolated word expresses the ability to update lower resolution levels with richer pixel density using some advanced processing techniques internally. It means, SJ6 Lengend can itself record 2K videos only but the end results are 4K with added 2K pixels. But, you will be able to adjust with this feature as SJ6 Legend offers incredible results at its 240 fps and 120 fps adjustments at 720p resolution level and the super capacity results at 1080p.

This action camera offers great footage results in day light; however, you may find little decay in quality at low light conditions. You may find little trouble with its low audio quality but overall service is appreciable.

You will find great color distribution in all SJ6 Legend camera photos with added sharpness in details. Every picture delivers great information but once you enlarge the view or take it out in full size you will notice blurriness in view. Users report impressive results in day light but performance naturally goes down with low light conditions. One more trouble with its 16MP lens resolution is that with long hour usage you may start facing camera freezing issues.

#### Image Stabilization and Fisheye Correction

SJ6 Legend is designed to offer great image stabilization service with its advanced Gyro Stabilization system. Even if you start recording videos at a road full of bumps, simply switch to your powerful gyro stabilizer and you will get fine details for whole footage. It can easily minimize the effect of all shaky up and down motions. Most of the users love to use SJ6 cam for their biking adventure as it can record every motion well while staying stick to handlebar or to the helmet.
