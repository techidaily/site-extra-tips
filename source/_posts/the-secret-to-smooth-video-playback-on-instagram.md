## The Secret to Smooth Video Playback on Instagram

We realize how aggravating it is when Instagram rotates your videos automatically. Instagram saves an orientation code and instantly adjusts an image or video if it isn't in the correct alignment. Regrettably, their programming isn't always accurate.

Now, if you want to learn and master how to fix this irritating issue, I suggest that you continue reading.

## **Why Is Instagram Constantly Flipping Your Video?**

When you post a video using your camera roll to Instagram Stories, it will automatically crop it to a 9:16 aspect ratio. Before you begin filming horizontally, you may need to manually correct your phone camera's direction. Failure to do so may result in films being posted sideways.

## **How To Rotate Videos on Instagram?**

You've created the ideal video, but it's on its side or upside down? In a couple of seconds, rotate and adjust your movie.

In the uploading process, Instagram users are unable to rotate their videos. However, you may apply filters to your video, mute or clip it, and replace the cover photo.

To help you rotate your Instagram videos, I prepared a list of alternatives below:

### **#2:** [Free Video Flip and Rotate](https://free-video-flip-and-rotate.en.uptodown.com/windows)

**It is available in Windows.**

Free Video Flip and Rotate is a free Windows software that, as the name implies, flips or rotates video images to restore them to their original aspect. It's as simple as loading the video and selecting the action you want it to take, which you can see in the preview of the movie you're configuring right away.

Free Video Flip and Rotate are one of the most valuable tools for changing the perspective of a video.

This freeware makes changing video orientation as simple as pressing A-B-C. Its features allow you to rotate the video into several specified angles to fit it into a horizontal format. Your video can even be turned 90 degrees either way!

Your clip can also be rotated vertically and horizontally using Free Video Flip and Rotate. This is extremely useful when fixing and adjusting the orientation of the source video. The only negative of this software is that it offers to download a browser toolbar, which you can disable during installation.

Here’s how you can flip your video using Free Video Flip and Rotate:

1. Import your video clips.

![instagram-flip-video-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/instagram-flip-video-4.jpg)

1. Choose between the flip or rotate options

![instagram-flip-video-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/instagram-flip-video-5.jpg)

1. Select your output format and save the video

![instagram-flip-video-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/instagram-flip-video-6.jpg)

### **#3:** [Video Rotator](https://www.videorotator.com/)

**It is available in Windows.**

Video Rotator also allows you to rotate and flip the orientation of your videos, making it simple to modify the direction of your films. The fantastic thing about this generator is that it covers a wide range of popular formats, including MP4, MOV, AVI, MPG, and FLV, so whatever file type your phone uses, the Video Rotator is likely to support it.

The biggest highlight of this tool is its straightforward interface, making every feature easy to understand. However, the tool may be missing some advanced capabilities that would render it the finest on the market.

Start flipping your videos with Video Rotator with the following steps below:

1. To add media to the folder list, click the "Add a File" button or drag and drop clips onto the software.

![instagram-flip-video-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/instagram-flip-video-7.jpg)

1. Select "Clockwise" or "Anticlockwise" as the "Rotate" option.

![instagram-flip-video-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/instagram-flip-video-10.jpg)

### **#4:** [VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)

**It is available on Windows, Mac, Linux, and Phone.**

Who knew VLC Media Player, the software we are using to watch films and other video formats, could also be used to rotate videos? VLC is a cross-platform multimedia player and system that supports most multimedia formats as well as DVDs, Audio CDs, VCDs, and a variety of broadcast technologies.

Apparently, the VLC media player can also adjust video orientation without the need for any other software. Simply pick 'Geometry' from the 'Tools Menu,' then 'Effects and Filters,' next 'Video Effects,' and then 'Geometry.' Because it is grayed out by default, you must click the 'Rotate' tab to enable the new format.

The best part about this player is that you can freely spin the movie without being restricted to any aspect. Furthermore, no additional software is required. On the other hand, for non-tech knowledgeable users, this approach may be a little too much.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to flip or rotate your video using VLC media player:

1. Load the wrongly-rotated clip from your computer in VLC Media Player.

![instagram-flip-video-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/instagram-flip-video-11.jpg)

### **#4:** [VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)

**It is available on Windows, Mac, Linux, and Phone.**

Who knew VLC Media Player, the software we are using to watch films and other video formats, could also be used to rotate videos? VLC is a cross-platform multimedia player and system that supports most multimedia formats as well as DVDs, Audio CDs, VCDs, and a variety of broadcast technologies.

Apparently, the VLC media player can also adjust video orientation without the need for any other software. Simply pick 'Geometry' from the 'Tools Menu,' then 'Effects and Filters,' next 'Video Effects,' and then 'Geometry.' Because it is grayed out by default, you must click the 'Rotate' tab to enable the new format.

The best part about this player is that you can freely spin the movie without being restricted to any aspect. Furthermore, no additional software is required. On the other hand, for non-tech knowledgeable users, this approach may be a little too much.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to flip or rotate your video using VLC media player:

1. Load the wrongly-rotated clip from your computer in VLC Media Player.

### **#4:** [VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)

**It is available on Windows, Mac, Linux, and Phone.**

Who knew VLC Media Player, the software we are using to watch films and other video formats, could also be used to rotate videos? VLC is a cross-platform multimedia player and system that supports most multimedia formats as well as DVDs, Audio CDs, VCDs, and a variety of broadcast technologies.

Apparently, the VLC media player can also adjust video orientation without the need for any other software. Simply pick 'Geometry' from the 'Tools Menu,' then 'Effects and Filters,' next 'Video Effects,' and then 'Geometry.' Because it is grayed out by default, you must click the 'Rotate' tab to enable the new format.

The best part about this player is that you can freely spin the movie without being restricted to any aspect. Furthermore, no additional software is required. On the other hand, for non-tech knowledgeable users, this approach may be a little too much.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to flip or rotate your video using VLC media player:

1. Load the wrongly-rotated clip from your computer in VLC Media Player.

### **Is The Camera on Instagram Inverted?**

The response is an emphatic yes to this inquiry. Because the camera in the Instagram app is inverted, a photo shot with the app and then uploaded to your account will appear to have been taken in a mirror.

This occurs because most individuals use their phone cameras upside down, requiring them to turn a photo from their camera roll horizontal before publishing it on Instagram.

![instagram-flip-video-](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/instagram-flip-video-1.jpg)

1. To access the video editing window, double-click on the clip in the timeline. Locate the "Rotate" option under the "Transform" menu. You can alter the rotation value by dragging the slider or entering a specific amount. Up to 360 degrees of rotation is possible.

### **What Aspect Ratio Do Instagram Videos Need?**

* 4:5 - 1080 x 1350px
* 1:1 - 1080 x 1080px
* 1.91:1 - 1080 x 608px
* IGTV dimensions are 1:1.55 - 420 x 654px

### **Is It Possible to Flip Instagram Stories?**

Indeed, you can flip Instagram stories. You just have to push and hold the video icon until the camera flips.

### **What Is the Best Way to Flip a Video?**

You can use a video editing software to flip a video. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the finest software in the market. You can flip your video with just minimal effort right away. You may also add effects and many more with this video editing software.

### **Is The Camera on Instagram Inverted?**

The response is an emphatic yes to this inquiry. Because the camera in the Instagram app is inverted, a photo shot with the app and then uploaded to your account will appear to have been taken in a mirror.

This occurs because most individuals use their phone cameras upside down, requiring them to turn a photo from their camera roll horizontal before publishing it on Instagram.
