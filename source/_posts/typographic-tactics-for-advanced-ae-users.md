## Typographic Tactics for Advanced AE Users

With the high demand for video consumption across the world, video editing has become a necessary task for most users. Even persons with general needs such as classes, presentations, meetings, etc. would need a video editor to complete their video project. A

After Effects is one of the most promising video editing applications available in the market. It facilitates its users with many editing features. One of such major functions of After Effects is it provides different fonts and text effects to its users. Here's a guide on **how to add fonts to After Effects**:

## Part 1\. How to add fonts to After Effects?

Adding fonts to any video editor is a crucial part because texts add a story to the video projects. They have a great impact on the cinematic quality of any video. For informative videos, the style of font decides the tone in which the texts are displayed.

Thus, selecting a proper font for the video becomes necessary in the post-production process. In the After Effects application, there are different fonts available for the users to load and use in any video. And if you are wondering **how to add font in After effects** to your video, then you can follow these steps:

* For adding the Adobe Fonts to After Effects, you will first need to enable them by signing in to the Creative Cloud application on your desktop. To do that, first, open the Creative Cloud, navigate to Assets, and click on Fonts.

![enable fonts adobe after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/enable-fonts-adobe-after-effects.jpg)

* This will direct you to the official website of Adobe Fonts where you can enable the fonts for your After Effects application. Once you are done with that click on the "Browse Fonts" and then in the opened tab, you will see a variety of fonts with their specified categories.

* These fonts are classified according to several attributes such as weight, height, and contrast and are created by certified typographers. Once you have found any font that you like, click on the "Activate" button and the theme will be installed on your Adobe After Effects.

* Now keep the Creative Cloud application up and running in your system and then open your After Effects application. There navigate to "Graphics" and then select "Add Fonts from Adobe Fonts".
* You can also use the font dropdown menu as a shortcut to use the fonts instantly. In Adobe After Effects interface, you can then select the "Character" panel to add or change the fonts to your videos.

## Part 2\. Types of Fonts in After Effects

Adobe After Effects provides a ton of families of fonts that can be added and used in video projects. These fonts are available on the Create Cloud application and also on the official website of adobe. Also, these fonts are categorized according to their height, weight, contrast as well as other attributes. And each of these fonts is shown with a preview saying "Typography" which can be selected instantly.

Some of the most famous fonts such as "typewriter", "Cursive Handwriting" and many more are categorized under their family of fonts and are very easy to access. Along with this, you can also select fonts with different character strokes and can alter their features while adding to your videos.

## Part 3\. How to use text effects in After Effects?

Adding text effects in Adobe After Effects is very easy and you can use these effects by following these steps:

* First, select the project video that you want to edit. Then navigate to "effects and presets" and search for the presets of the texts that you want to edit.

![effects and presets adobe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/effects-and-presets-adobe.jpg)

* Now, add that text effect to your video by clicking on it and dragging and dropping it on your video. Then select any animation preset for your text from "Adobe Bridge".
* Then slide the keyframes to set the text effect on the section of the video where you want to add your text. You can also compose the text by clicking on it and editing it for adjusting its content, height, width, opacity, and color.
* After you are done, save the project and your text effects will be added to the final video successfully.
