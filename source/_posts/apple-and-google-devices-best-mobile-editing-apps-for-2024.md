## Quick Glance: Top 3 Picks for Mobile Photo Editing Apps

Among the many options available in 2024, three apps have consistently stood out: Filmora, VSCO, and Apple Photos. These photo editing apps combine powerful editing tools with user-friendly interfaces, making them our top picks for iPhone and Android users:

### [Filmora](#1Filmora)

Filmora is fantastic for making composite images, which means you can blend different pics into one artwork. Plus, it lets you edit/manipulate images, add still images to videos and use images as overlays.

## What makes the best photo editing app for iPhone or Android?

When choosing the best photo editing apps, it's easy to get swept away, as there are endless options, each promising magical results. However, many of these apps rely more on aggressive marketing and expensive subscriptions than on their actual merits. These apps might enhance your photos - after all, most editing tools will. But you might find yourself overpaying for basic features that you could get for free elsewhere in more user-friendly formats.

Here’s what we consider before an app makes the cut:

### User-Friendly Interface

First things first, the app needs to be easy to navigate. No one wants to spend hours figuring out where the basic tools are or how to apply a simple filter. The best apps should make it easy to jump right in, with intuitive controls and a clean layout.

### Powerful Editing Features

The app should offer a comprehensive suite of editing tools. This includes not just basic adjustments (like exposure, contrast, color, and cropping), but also advanced tools such as curves, HSL adjustments, and local edits. These features allow anyone to perform in-depth tweaking and fine-tuning of images.

### Speed and Efficiency

Let’s be real, no one likes a laggy app. The app should be able to handle real-time editing smoothly without crashing. This is particularly true when you’re tweaking larger high-resolution images.

### Fair and Transparent Pricing

The best photo editing app should come with fair pricing and be free of intrusive ads. Their pricing should be straightforward and justified by the features they offer, without hidden costs or tricks to lock you into a subscription.

### Repeatable Results

The best apps should provide reliable, predictable results you can count on whenever you edit a photo. This consistency allows you to develop and refine your unique style without the app's quirks getting in the way.

## How do we test the best photo editing apps for iPhone or Android?

We started by downloading different apps, paying close attention to the size and the permissions each app required. We thoroughly tested each photo editing app’s user interface to see if they are user-friendly for beginners and sufficiently advanced for experienced editors.

Next, we imported several images into each app to test both the basic and advanced editing features. We also assessed how responsive and versatile these features were and monitored the apps' performance and stability on various devices.

We also considered cost efficiency by comparing the value provided in both free and premium versions. Additionally, we reviewed the quality of customer support and the frequency of updates. Finally, we considered real user feedback to ensure our recommendations meet technical standards and reflect genuine user satisfaction.

Out of all the photo editing apps we tested, ten stood out as the clear winners. These apps didn't just perform well - they also produced high-quality outputs.

## What makes the best photo editing app for iPhone or Android?

When choosing the best photo editing apps, it's easy to get swept away, as there are endless options, each promising magical results. However, many of these apps rely more on aggressive marketing and expensive subscriptions than on their actual merits. These apps might enhance your photos - after all, most editing tools will. But you might find yourself overpaying for basic features that you could get for free elsewhere in more user-friendly formats.

Here’s what we consider before an app makes the cut:

First things first, the app needs to be easy to navigate. No one wants to spend hours figuring out where the basic tools are or how to apply a simple filter. The best apps should make it easy to jump right in, with intuitive controls and a clean layout.

### Powerful Editing Features

The app should offer a comprehensive suite of editing tools. This includes not just basic adjustments (like exposure, contrast, color, and cropping), but also advanced tools such as curves, HSL adjustments, and local edits. These features allow anyone to perform in-depth tweaking and fine-tuning of images.

### Speed and Efficiency

Let’s be real, no one likes a laggy app. The app should be able to handle real-time editing smoothly without crashing. This is particularly true when you’re tweaking larger high-resolution images.

### Fair and Transparent Pricing

The best photo editing app should come with fair pricing and be free of intrusive ads. Their pricing should be straightforward and justified by the features they offer, without hidden costs or tricks to lock you into a subscription.

### Repeatable Results

The best apps should provide reliable, predictable results you can count on whenever you edit a photo. This consistency allows you to develop and refine your unique style without the app's quirks getting in the way.

## How do we test the best photo editing apps for iPhone or Android?

We started by downloading different apps, paying close attention to the size and the permissions each app required. We thoroughly tested each photo editing app’s user interface to see if they are user-friendly for beginners and sufficiently advanced for experienced editors.

Next, we imported several images into each app to test both the basic and advanced editing features. We also assessed how responsive and versatile these features were and monitored the apps' performance and stability on various devices.

We also considered cost efficiency by comparing the value provided in both free and premium versions. Additionally, we reviewed the quality of customer support and the frequency of updates. Finally, we considered real user feedback to ensure our recommendations meet technical standards and reflect genuine user satisfaction.
