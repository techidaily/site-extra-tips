In Tantric and Vedic traditions, a mantra is repeated 108 times. It's a lot more powerful than 107 or 109 repetitions. That's why 108 prayer beads are used in the Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Islamic, and Taoist religions to help maintain a sense of spiritual well-being.

It's the Gayatri mantra, one of the oldest and most powerful mantras in Sanskrit. Gayatri means life force, life essence, and power of the breath. If you chant the Gayatri mantra and strongly establish it in your mind, living according to the duty you are born for and the work ordained for you, you will lead an entire and happy life.

This Gayatri Mantra duration is 1:11:20 long.
