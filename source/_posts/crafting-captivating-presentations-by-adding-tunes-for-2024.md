## Crafting Captivating Presentations by Adding Tunes

"I am looking to create a compelling assignment, and I need someone who can help me promptly answer how to add music to PowerPoint.”

Adding a music piece helps the PPT be attractive and enjoyable. Any presentation needs to be understood by the audience who is wandering it. Picking the viewers' interest is the standard task for the person presenting the presentation. Thus, make the PowerPoint as creative as possible.

Without any further ado, let’s read a quick step-by-step tutorial to add music to PowerPoint as follows.

#### In this article

01 [How to add music to PowerPoint?](#Part 1)

02 [Can I play music automatically on PowerPoint](#Part 2)

03 [Get music to play throughout a PowerPoint](#Part 3)

04 [Add more songs to a PowerPoint presentation](#Part 4)

## Part 1 How to add music to PowerPoint?

Before you add music to PowerPoint, note specific points.

Your presentation size will increase by the size of the MP3 music file you add after the audio files are embedded directly into PPT.

For instance, the size of your presentation will magnify by 17MB if you add a song of 17MB to the presentation.

So, the solution is that you need to compress your file size accordingly.

### Steps on how to insert music in PowerPoint presentation

##### Step2 Click the Insert tab

##### Step3 Open the Audio drop-down (in the Media group)

##### Step4 Select Audio on My PC

##### Step5 Visit the folder on your computer

##### Step6 Select the Audio file

##### Step7 Hit the Insert tab

Consequently, the audio file gets embedded in your presentation.

![ppt audio options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/ppt-audio-options.jpg)

After the music embeds in your presentation, anyone who opens the presentation can access and play the music inside PowerPoint.

Your song will play within the Click Sequence of your presentation by default.

After inserting music into your presentation, you can then convert your entire presentation into a video and share it with your colleagues.

## Part 1 How to add music to PowerPoint?

Before you add music to PowerPoint, note specific points.

Your presentation size will increase by the size of the MP3 music file you add after the audio files are embedded directly into PPT.

For instance, the size of your presentation will magnify by 17MB if you add a song of 17MB to the presentation.

So, the solution is that you need to compress your file size accordingly.

##### Step3 Remember that the In Click Sequence function is only available in PowerPoint 2016 and the latest versions

Click From Beginning to test the sound over the Slide Show tab.

Reminder: It would help if you keep your computer equipped with speakers or sound cards to hear sounds or music.

## Part 3 Get music to play throughout a PowerPoint

You can add music to your PowerPoint and play it across slides in the slide show background.

If you wish to add audio or music from the web, you have to download it to your computer before using it in a presentation.

### Steps to play a song across slides

##### Step1 Select Audio on the Insert tab and choose Audio on My PC

##### Step2 Browse to the music file you want to use within the File Explorer, and then select Insert

##### Step3 Select Play in Background within the audio icon chosen over the slide

![ppt playback](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/ppt-playback.jpg)

Play in Background helps automatically start the audio file during a slide show and makes the audio play throughout the multiple slides.
