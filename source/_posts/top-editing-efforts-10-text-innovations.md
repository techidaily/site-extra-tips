### 6\. Blurry Fade on Text Effect

Blurry fade on is such a pleasing effect for the human eye especially when it is in animated form. The blurry fade on effect is like looking at a word with your specs on while the words in its surrounding come with blur effect. This text effect is widely used when there is a need to highlight certain words in a sentence.

![blurry fade on text effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/blurry-fade-on-text-effect.jpg)

In fact, the text effect is used to highlight a few characters in a word while the others remain blurred. You can also use the effect when you are making transitions between different texts and titles. It is more like an add-on to the usual fade on effect as it adds a blurring effect. It is important to get the attention of the viewers to specific texts.

### 7\. Type on Text Effect

The type on text effect is also referred to as the typewriter effect. In this effect, the characters in the text appear one by one as if someone is typing it in real-time with a typewriter. A blinking cursor is placed at the end for the characters for a more realistic look. The text effect is useful for both one-liners as well as paragraphs.

![type on text effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/type-on-text-effect.jpg)

It breaks the monotony of showing an entire paragraph at once. Sometimes, a modified version of the type on text effect is used whereby some characters are shown and they are deleted backward and re-typed. This helps in getting the immediate attention of the viewers and they focus on the re-typed characters or words.

### 8\. Animate Along a Path

If you are looking for a customized animation for the texts in your video, you should opt for animate along a path effect. The text will move in the pre-defined path while moving along the path, there can be additional animation for the words and characters. The text is widely used for showing one-liner that comes out of nowhere and moves out of the frame following its path.

![animate along a path text effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/animate-along-a-path-text-effect.jpg)

You can use the effect to show certain lines that are common throughout the video. Besides, you can use it while making transition from one scene to another. Some video creators use them for opening and editing credits so that it can keep the audiences hooked instead of the usual opening and ending credits.

### 9\. Slide Text Effect

If you have watched any informational video, you must have seen small notes sliding in from a bar at the bottom left corner. That is what the slide text effect is all about. The text slides into the video frame from a border or a stripe. The sliding in effect can be from any direction as per your preference.

![stripe text video effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/stripe-text-video-effect.jpg)

### 9\. Slide Text Effect

If you have watched any informational video, you must have seen small notes sliding in from a bar at the bottom left corner. That is what the slide text effect is all about. The text slides into the video frame from a border or a stripe. The sliding in effect can be from any direction as per your preference.

![slide text effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/slide-text-effect.jpg)

Generally, the slide effect for text is accompanied by a highlighted background so that the text is legible. It is suitable for showing important notes in a few sentences such as showing some facts about a place. The effect is widely used in videos related to news or videos where there are more photos and texts and less voice narration.

### 10\. Stripe Text Effect

Just like the slide text effect, the stripe text effect is equally common in todayâ€™s informational videos that you get to see on social media and video streaming platforms. The text appears on the screen out of nowhere and the text gets surrounded by stripes on both sides.
