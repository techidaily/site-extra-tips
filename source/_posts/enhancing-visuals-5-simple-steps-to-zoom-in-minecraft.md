## Way 1\. Change FOV in Options

Although the PC version of Minecraft doesn't come with a built-in zoom in or out feature, you may change the field of view to suit your tastes. A higher field of view setting will allow you to see more in a single frame, but everything will look a little bit smaller. A zoomed-in display is possible by lowering the field of vision and limiting the number of objects you can see.

Step1 To access the in-game menu, launch a game and hit the Esc key on your keyboard.

Step2 In the game menu, choose the Options... button.

Step3 Now, use the slider to alter your range of vision. The slider will be positioned in the center by default. To get a closer look at your surroundings, click on it and move it to the left of your screen. However, moving the FOV slider all the way to the left also means that you won't be able to see as much during gameplay.

![minecraft fov button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/minecraft-fov-button.jpg)

Step4 To save the new FOV settings after finishing adjusting the slider and being satisfied with the field of vision, click Done at the bottom of the page.
