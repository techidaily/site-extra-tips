### How To Add iTunes Music To iMovie

● Once you have an open project on iMovie, tap on 'Add Media.

● Select 'Audio' then click on 'My Music.' Look for the song you want according to category.

● Tap on a song to preview it.

● To add the songs to your project, tap on the large (+)/Add Audio icon.

You can utilize iTunes music in iMovie, but not tracks with DRM protection. You could receive a warning if the iTunes song you bought says it's protected under DRM. Even unprotected tracks stored in the cloud must be downloaded first before iMovie can use them. The same applies if you want to add Apple music to iMovie.
