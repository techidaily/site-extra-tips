The X70 has a porcelain body atop the glass, a Fluorite AG surface, and a highly immersive 3D curving display for luxury design aesthetics. VIVO X70 was launched on September 30, 2021, and is available for $725 in 128GB ROM and 8GB RAM.

The X70 also has an avant-garde appearance in Enigma Black. The phone also has the Vivo X70's 32-megapixel selfie sensor with an f/2.45 aperture.

It has four rear cameras: a 50-megapixel main sensor, a 48-megapixel auxiliary camera with such an f/1.6 ultra-wide aperture, and Gimbal compatibility. It also features a 12-megapixel portraits sensor along with an 8-megapixel sensor that has a periscope-shaped optic with OIS.

### 6\. [Oppo Find X3 Pro](https://www.oppo.com/en/smartphones/series-find-x/find-x3-pro/)

Oppo's March 2021 flagship takes a drastically different approach than its predecessor when it comes to the camera arrangement. It is available on the market for $996.88.

Whereas most rear camera devices include a powerful telephoto lens, the Find X3 Pro has only a 2x optical zoom lens subsystem, with the most unexpected entrance being what the company calls a microlens camera, which can take shots at up to 60x magnification and includes its ring illumination for a genuinely different view.

The Oppo Find X3 Pro has four cameras on the back, including a main 50MP lens omnidirectional, an f/1.8 aperture, and OIS capability.

### 7\. [iQOO 7 Legend](https://www.iqoo.com/in/products/iqoo7legend)

### 9\. iPhone 12 Pro Max

The largest and most opulent of Apple's 2020 iPhones, the 12 Pro Max, looks to have a similar three-sensor layout to its predecessor, but it claims a slew of extra innovations, including a sector first. Released on October 11, 2020, it has a starting price of $999.

Since the announcement of the iPhone 12 Pro Max, the sensor-shift OIS (optical image stabilization) technology has been the camera's most talked-about feature. It has helped to improve Apple's already excellent night mode photography, resulting in even less noise and crisper pictures than before.

The three 12Mp sensors (a primary, 120Â° ultra-wide, and 2.5x optical zoom telephoto) shot with a satisfying uniformity and assurance that competing camera phones don't have.

### 10\. [Xiaomi Mi Note 10](https://www.mi.com/global/mi-note-10/)

The Xiaomi Mi Note 10 has a quality finish and equipment that distinguishes it from the competition. The phone has a higher frame rate of 90Hz, which offers a smooth experience, and it is HDR10+ approved. It features a selfie camera blow cut-out in the top-left quadrant, giving the display 19.5:9 ratios.

The optics are the major focus of the Mi Note 10, with the phone receiving a 108-megapixel sensor as the main structure, which has a 1/1.33-inch sensor and OIS. The second sensor is a 13-megapixel ultra-wide lens with a 123-degree field of view, which sits beside a 2-megapixel macro camera and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. Moreover, it was launched on February 13, 2020, and has a starting price of $425.

## Part 2: What's the difference between AIS, OIS, and EIS?

The majority of people prefer OIS to EIS and AIS. A hardware method is usually superior to a software platform since EIS is simply a repair solution that causes image resolution deterioration by cutting it and predicting what it would look like if it were constant.

Because Huawei just recently introduced AIS, most people are unaware of it. However, you'll understand the difference after reading the following:

### **Optical Image Stabilization (OIS)**

OIS is a motor-powered mechanical image stabilization technique that stabilizes the shooting process by sensing a camera shake and repositioning the lens using clutches to counterbalance it.

### **AI Image Stabilization (AIS)**

AIS is an image stabilization technique driven by AI that enables the camera to record long exposure films or pictures, particularly in low light circumstances, while preserving a clear and detailed image free of blur.

### **Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS)**

EIS is an image stabilization technology that examines the picture of about two-thirds of the camera sensor and then uses the images at the borders to adjust for camera motions. This is the strategy used by the vast majority of cameras.

**Conclusion**

Since you don't always have a camera to capture smooth videos, having an OIS camera phone is the need of the hour. To help you in the cause, we have reviewed some excellent smartphones in this article. Although a phone with video stabilization can cost a lot, there are some affordable ones too. Pick the one that falls in your price bracket and start capturing smooth videos.

### 6\. [Oppo Find X3 Pro](https://www.oppo.com/en/smartphones/series-find-x/find-x3-pro/)

Oppo's March 2021 flagship takes a drastically different approach than its predecessor when it comes to the camera arrangement. It is available on the market for $996.88.

Whereas most rear camera devices include a powerful telephoto lens, the Find X3 Pro has only a 2x optical zoom lens subsystem, with the most unexpected entrance being what the company calls a microlens camera, which can take shots at up to 60x magnification and includes its ring illumination for a genuinely different view.

The Oppo Find X3 Pro has four cameras on the back, including a main 50MP lens omnidirectional, an f/1.8 aperture, and OIS capability.

### 7\. [iQOO 7 Legend](https://www.iqoo.com/in/products/iqoo7legend)

This year, Vivo has chosen to release several of its gaming-oriented iQOO phones internationally, beginning with the iQOO 7 Legend on April 26, 2021\. It is available on the marketplace for $579.

An HRR OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate is on hand, and the Snapdragon 888 CPU drives those pixels. In addition, for a comprehensive multimedia adventure, the phone includes a set of powerful stereo speakers.

It is among the few game phones with a telephoto camera. It only has a 2x optical zoom, but it's more than chopping from the primary camera. The ultra-wide is also 13MP rather than the more normal 8MP, and the primary 48MP camera has OIS.

### 8\. [Google Pixel 6 Pro](https://store.google.com/product/pixel%5F6%5Fpro)

Google has shaken things up for 2021, releasing the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro on October 28, 2021, featuring the company's new Tensor hardware and a revised Android 12 experience and an entirely new design a considerably improved triple back camera.

The camera system is based on a new 50Mp primary sensor, which is the first time Google has changed an entry's main image hardware since the Pixel 3.

The outcome is a camera with an incredible dynamic range, teamed with a 12Mp ultra-wide lens that gives great color and contrast constancy, as well as a periscopic 48Mp telephoto sensor with a 4x optical zoom lens; a very far cry from the Pixel line's previous single-sensor approach to photography.

It is available for purchase, with prices beginning at $899 for 128GB of storage. Upgrading to 256GB costs $999, and 512GB costs $1,099.

### 9\. iPhone 12 Pro Max

The largest and most opulent of Apple's 2020 iPhones, the 12 Pro Max, looks to have a similar three-sensor layout to its predecessor, but it claims a slew of extra innovations, including a sector first. Released on October 11, 2020, it has a starting price of $999.

Since the announcement of the iPhone 12 Pro Max, the sensor-shift OIS (optical image stabilization) technology has been the camera's most talked-about feature. It has helped to improve Apple's already excellent night mode photography, resulting in even less noise and crisper pictures than before.

The three 12Mp sensors (a primary, 120Â° ultra-wide, and 2.5x optical zoom telephoto) shot with a satisfying uniformity and assurance that competing camera phones don't have.

### 10\. [Xiaomi Mi Note 10](https://www.mi.com/global/mi-note-10/)

The Xiaomi Mi Note 10 has a quality finish and equipment that distinguishes it from the competition. The phone has a higher frame rate of 90Hz, which offers a smooth experience, and it is HDR10+ approved. It features a selfie camera blow cut-out in the top-left quadrant, giving the display 19.5:9 ratios.

The optics are the major focus of the Mi Note 10, with the phone receiving a 108-megapixel sensor as the main structure, which has a 1/1.33-inch sensor and OIS. The second sensor is a 13-megapixel ultra-wide lens with a 123-degree field of view, which sits beside a 2-megapixel macro camera and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. Moreover, it was launched on February 13, 2020, and has a starting price of $425.

## Part 2: What's the difference between AIS, OIS, and EIS?

The majority of people prefer OIS to EIS and AIS. A hardware method is usually superior to a software platform since EIS is simply a repair solution that causes image resolution deterioration by cutting it and predicting what it would look like if it were constant.

Because Huawei just recently introduced AIS, most people are unaware of it. However, you'll understand the difference after reading the following:

### **Optical Image Stabilization (OIS)**

OIS is a motor-powered mechanical image stabilization technique that stabilizes the shooting process by sensing a camera shake and repositioning the lens using clutches to counterbalance it.

### **AI Image Stabilization (AIS)**

AIS is an image stabilization technique driven by AI that enables the camera to record long exposure films or pictures, particularly in low light circumstances, while preserving a clear and detailed image free of blur.

### **Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS)**

EIS is an image stabilization technology that examines the picture of about two-thirds of the camera sensor and then uses the images at the borders to adjust for camera motions. This is the strategy used by the vast majority of cameras.

**Conclusion**

Since you don't always have a camera to capture smooth videos, having an OIS camera phone is the need of the hour. To help you in the cause, we have reviewed some excellent smartphones in this article. Although a phone with video stabilization can cost a lot, there are some affordable ones too. Pick the one that falls in your price bracket and start capturing smooth videos.

If you capture many videos with your smartphone, whether for personal use or for uploading to YouTube or Facebook or if you are into smartphone cinematography, getting Optical Image Stabilization (OIS) in your smartphone may substantially enhance the video quality.

Some years ago, the OIS was a unique function accessible on high-end smartphones. As time passes, most of the devices will have this capability. However, if you need an OIS camera phone right now, don't worry. Some of the excellent and affordable smartphones are reviewed in this article.
