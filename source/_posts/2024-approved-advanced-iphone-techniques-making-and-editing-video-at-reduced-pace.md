![capture still image](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/still-camera.JPG)

**Supported Slow** \- Mo Shooting Modes- Do you know the slow motion recording modes supported by iPhone?

iPhone 5s only can capture 720p at 120 FPS. iPhone 6/6 Plus/6s/6s Plus, iPhone 7/7 Plus can capture 720p at 240 FPS. iPhone 8/8 Plus and iPhone X can even capture 1080p HD at 240 FPS.

**Space used by slo-mo video** \- It is vital to know that the iPhone 5s onwards iOS devices record slow motion video at 120 frames per second (fps). If you record slow motion video at higher frame rates, it takes lesser space than 120fps video.

The slo-mo video recorded at 1080p resolution at 120 fps uses approximately 375 MB per minute storage space and slow motion video iPhone resolution of 720p at 240 fps uses approximately 300 MB per minute.

**Is slow motion video from normal video possible** \- A higher frame rate than normal is required to record a slow motion video., Playing a slow motion video to normal is possible but the reverse is impossible. You get a jerky video with frames jumping here and there when you try to watch a slow motion video from normal. It appears as a series of still snapshots rather than a constant video.
