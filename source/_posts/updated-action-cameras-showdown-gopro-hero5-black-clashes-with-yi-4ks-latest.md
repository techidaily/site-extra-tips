[Full review for Hero5 Black >>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

 There are two major aspects that can be considered for comparison: Hardware and Performance. Both of these are compared in detail as below:

#### 1.Hardware

**Touch Screen:** When displays of both these cameras are compared then it was observed that YI 4K provides better response as compared to [GoPro Hero5 Black](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Size of display is also larger in case of YI 4K as it goes up to 2.19” whereas Hero5 has 2” screen. The Touch Screen is found more interactive in YI 4K whereas in case of Hero5 you may need to press twice especially when it is wet. The front LCD display of GoPro provides additional settings menu for easy control.

**Waterproof:** The biggest benefit of GoPro Hero5 is that it can serve you underwater but YI 4K cannot as you need additional protective case for this camera. But you cannot save your recordings from handling noise in case of GoPro unit. When you go underwater with YI 4K while using protective housing then it is not possible to use its touch screen feature and secondly the audio quality decays by large extent.

**Battery Life:** Both of these camera units come with removable batteries but in case of Hero5 you can enjoy recording only up to 1hr 40 minutes with its 1220mAh battery backup whereas the YI 4K camera is developed with 1400mAh battery that can serve perfectly for 2 hours. Prefer to use these cameras with WiFi connections turned off in order to save battery for longer duration.

#### 2.Performance

**Image Resolution:** Photo quality of both cameras is 12MP and digital image stabilization feature is added to both units. You can find much warmer and smoother quality with Yi 4K whereas GoPro offers services for RAW photography.

**Video Resolution:** When we talk about the video resolution then different ratings must be compared to get better idea about performance. When we talk about Go Pro Hero5 then maximum video quality is offered to be 4K at 30fps, 2.7k at 60fps, 1080p with 120fps and 720p at 240fps. On the other side in case of Xiaomi YI 4K you will be able to avail 4K at 30fps, 2.5K at 30fps, 1440p with 60fps, 1080p for 120fps and 720p with 200fps only.

**Audio Quality:** Audio Quality of GoPro Hero5 is rated to be much superior as compared to Yi 4K camera unit. The housing helps to protect Hero5 from wind noise but it can perform even better without housing as compared to Yi 4K. Hero5 Black comes with 3 microphones and it helps to make better selection for audio streams.

**Price:** GoPro Hero5 can be ordered online with a payment of $399 but you will be glad to know that equally featured Xiaomi Yi Action Camera is cheaper as well as affordable with a price tag of $199.99 only. When we compare specs and hardware of both these cameras then Yi 4K is observed to provide all desired high performance results while meeting all needs of sports persons so you can think of buying Xiaomi product that falls in your budget.

#### Conclusion

 Almost all features are discussed above and it is observed that if you are searching for a camera to record videos underwater or in rainy seasons then it is best idea to invest on GoPro Hero5 but in case of other adventurous sports activities Yi 4K can also provide you impressive results and it is a fit to budget camera unit. The Video and Photo quality is almost similar for both units but the battery backup of Yi 4K is again better then GoPro unit. So it is better to decide your budget and needs first and then pick the right camera unit for you.

 There are two major aspects that can be considered for comparison: Hardware and Performance. Both of these are compared in detail as below:

#### 1.Hardware

**Touch Screen:** When displays of both these cameras are compared then it was observed that YI 4K provides better response as compared to [GoPro Hero5 Black](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Size of display is also larger in case of YI 4K as it goes up to 2.19” whereas Hero5 has 2” screen. The Touch Screen is found more interactive in YI 4K whereas in case of Hero5 you may need to press twice especially when it is wet. The front LCD display of GoPro provides additional settings menu for easy control.

**Waterproof:** The biggest benefit of GoPro Hero5 is that it can serve you underwater but YI 4K cannot as you need additional protective case for this camera. But you cannot save your recordings from handling noise in case of GoPro unit. When you go underwater with YI 4K while using protective housing then it is not possible to use its touch screen feature and secondly the audio quality decays by large extent.

**Battery Life:** Both of these camera units come with removable batteries but in case of Hero5 you can enjoy recording only up to 1hr 40 minutes with its 1220mAh battery backup whereas the YI 4K camera is developed with 1400mAh battery that can serve perfectly for 2 hours. Prefer to use these cameras with WiFi connections turned off in order to save battery for longer duration.

#### 2.Performance

**Image Resolution:** Photo quality of both cameras is 12MP and digital image stabilization feature is added to both units. You can find much warmer and smoother quality with Yi 4K whereas GoPro offers services for RAW photography.

**Video Resolution:** When we talk about the video resolution then different ratings must be compared to get better idea about performance. When we talk about Go Pro Hero5 then maximum video quality is offered to be 4K at 30fps, 2.7k at 60fps, 1080p with 120fps and 720p at 240fps. On the other side in case of Xiaomi YI 4K you will be able to avail 4K at 30fps, 2.5K at 30fps, 1440p with 60fps, 1080p for 120fps and 720p with 200fps only.

**Audio Quality:** Audio Quality of GoPro Hero5 is rated to be much superior as compared to Yi 4K camera unit. The housing helps to protect Hero5 from wind noise but it can perform even better without housing as compared to Yi 4K. Hero5 Black comes with 3 microphones and it helps to make better selection for audio streams.

**Price:** GoPro Hero5 can be ordered online with a payment of $399 but you will be glad to know that equally featured Xiaomi Yi Action Camera is cheaper as well as affordable with a price tag of $199.99 only. When we compare specs and hardware of both these cameras then Yi 4K is observed to provide all desired high performance results while meeting all needs of sports persons so you can think of buying Xiaomi product that falls in your budget.

#### Conclusion

 Almost all features are discussed above and it is observed that if you are searching for a camera to record videos underwater or in rainy seasons then it is best idea to invest on GoPro Hero5 but in case of other adventurous sports activities Yi 4K can also provide you impressive results and it is a fit to budget camera unit. The Video and Photo quality is almost similar for both units but the battery backup of Yi 4K is again better then GoPro unit. So it is better to decide your budget and needs first and then pick the right camera unit for you.

[Full review for Hero5 Black >>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

 There are two major aspects that can be considered for comparison: Hardware and Performance. Both of these are compared in detail as below:

#### 1.Hardware

**Touch Screen:** When displays of both these cameras are compared then it was observed that YI 4K provides better response as compared to [GoPro Hero5 Black](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Size of display is also larger in case of YI 4K as it goes up to 2.19” whereas Hero5 has 2” screen. The Touch Screen is found more interactive in YI 4K whereas in case of Hero5 you may need to press twice especially when it is wet. The front LCD display of GoPro provides additional settings menu for easy control.

**Waterproof:** The biggest benefit of GoPro Hero5 is that it can serve you underwater but YI 4K cannot as you need additional protective case for this camera. But you cannot save your recordings from handling noise in case of GoPro unit. When you go underwater with YI 4K while using protective housing then it is not possible to use its touch screen feature and secondly the audio quality decays by large extent.

**Battery Life:** Both of these camera units come with removable batteries but in case of Hero5 you can enjoy recording only up to 1hr 40 minutes with its 1220mAh battery backup whereas the YI 4K camera is developed with 1400mAh battery that can serve perfectly for 2 hours. Prefer to use these cameras with WiFi connections turned off in order to save battery for longer duration.

#### 2.Performance

**Image Resolution:** Photo quality of both cameras is 12MP and digital image stabilization feature is added to both units. You can find much warmer and smoother quality with Yi 4K whereas GoPro offers services for RAW photography.

**Video Resolution:** When we talk about the video resolution then different ratings must be compared to get better idea about performance. When we talk about Go Pro Hero5 then maximum video quality is offered to be 4K at 30fps, 2.7k at 60fps, 1080p with 120fps and 720p at 240fps. On the other side in case of Xiaomi YI 4K you will be able to avail 4K at 30fps, 2.5K at 30fps, 1440p with 60fps, 1080p for 120fps and 720p with 200fps only.

**Audio Quality:** Audio Quality of GoPro Hero5 is rated to be much superior as compared to Yi 4K camera unit. The housing helps to protect Hero5 from wind noise but it can perform even better without housing as compared to Yi 4K. Hero5 Black comes with 3 microphones and it helps to make better selection for audio streams.

**Price:** GoPro Hero5 can be ordered online with a payment of $399 but you will be glad to know that equally featured Xiaomi Yi Action Camera is cheaper as well as affordable with a price tag of $199.99 only. When we compare specs and hardware of both these cameras then Yi 4K is observed to provide all desired high performance results while meeting all needs of sports persons so you can think of buying Xiaomi product that falls in your budget.

#### Conclusion

 Almost all features are discussed above and it is observed that if you are searching for a camera to record videos underwater or in rainy seasons then it is best idea to invest on GoPro Hero5 but in case of other adventurous sports activities Yi 4K can also provide you impressive results and it is a fit to budget camera unit. The Video and Photo quality is almost similar for both units but the battery backup of Yi 4K is again better then GoPro unit. So it is better to decide your budget and needs first and then pick the right camera unit for you.

[Full review for Hero5 Black >>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

 There are two major aspects that can be considered for comparison: Hardware and Performance. Both of these are compared in detail as below:

#### 1.Hardware

**Touch Screen:** When displays of both these cameras are compared then it was observed that YI 4K provides better response as compared to [GoPro Hero5 Black](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Size of display is also larger in case of YI 4K as it goes up to 2.19” whereas Hero5 has 2” screen. The Touch Screen is found more interactive in YI 4K whereas in case of Hero5 you may need to press twice especially when it is wet. The front LCD display of GoPro provides additional settings menu for easy control.

**Waterproof:** The biggest benefit of GoPro Hero5 is that it can serve you underwater but YI 4K cannot as you need additional protective case for this camera. But you cannot save your recordings from handling noise in case of GoPro unit. When you go underwater with YI 4K while using protective housing then it is not possible to use its touch screen feature and secondly the audio quality decays by large extent.

**Battery Life:** Both of these camera units come with removable batteries but in case of Hero5 you can enjoy recording only up to 1hr 40 minutes with its 1220mAh battery backup whereas the YI 4K camera is developed with 1400mAh battery that can serve perfectly for 2 hours. Prefer to use these cameras with WiFi connections turned off in order to save battery for longer duration.

#### 2.Performance

**Image Resolution:** Photo quality of both cameras is 12MP and digital image stabilization feature is added to both units. You can find much warmer and smoother quality with Yi 4K whereas GoPro offers services for RAW photography.

**Video Resolution:** When we talk about the video resolution then different ratings must be compared to get better idea about performance. When we talk about Go Pro Hero5 then maximum video quality is offered to be 4K at 30fps, 2.7k at 60fps, 1080p with 120fps and 720p at 240fps. On the other side in case of Xiaomi YI 4K you will be able to avail 4K at 30fps, 2.5K at 30fps, 1440p with 60fps, 1080p for 120fps and 720p with 200fps only.

**Audio Quality:** Audio Quality of GoPro Hero5 is rated to be much superior as compared to Yi 4K camera unit. The housing helps to protect Hero5 from wind noise but it can perform even better without housing as compared to Yi 4K. Hero5 Black comes with 3 microphones and it helps to make better selection for audio streams.

**Price:** GoPro Hero5 can be ordered online with a payment of $399 but you will be glad to know that equally featured Xiaomi Yi Action Camera is cheaper as well as affordable with a price tag of $199.99 only. When we compare specs and hardware of both these cameras then Yi 4K is observed to provide all desired high performance results while meeting all needs of sports persons so you can think of buying Xiaomi product that falls in your budget.

#### Conclusion

 Almost all features are discussed above and it is observed that if you are searching for a camera to record videos underwater or in rainy seasons then it is best idea to invest on GoPro Hero5 but in case of other adventurous sports activities Yi 4K can also provide you impressive results and it is a fit to budget camera unit. The Video and Photo quality is almost similar for both units but the battery backup of Yi 4K is again better then GoPro unit. So it is better to decide your budget and needs first and then pick the right camera unit for you.
