## Testimonials on Screen: Marketing's Best Friend

Video testimonials are one of the best ways to market your company. In fact, according to a recent study, 92% of consumers say they heavily rely on online reviews and testimonials when making purchasing decisions. 88% of those consumers say they trust those testimonials as much as personal recommendations from their friends, family members, and colleagues. This means that if you can get your clients or customers talking about how great your products or services are on camera, it will help them make buying decisions, reinforce your brand message and build relationships with their followers and peers.

## Why Video Testimonials Are Important for Marketing

### Video testimonials help customers make their buying decisions

Video testimonials are an amazing way to demonstrate the value of your business. They help customers make their buying decisions, they're more effective than written testimonials, and they are more authentic and believable than the written ones.

Video testimonials help reinforce your company's message. When you see a product or service demonstrated in action by someone who is actually using it in real life—which is what happens when you watch a video—you can get a much better understanding of what it does for people who experience it firsthand. This can make an enormous difference when trying to convey the benefits of something like an electric toothbrush or headphones compared to just reading about them on paper or hearing about them from someone else who may not be fully knowledgeable about how awesome these products really are!

It also helps build relationships with potential clients because videos allow us to connect with people on a personal level in ways that would otherwise be impossible through text-only formats such as email messages only ever so briefly exchanged between two parties before being quickly forgotten forever when we move onto other things.

### Video testimonials help reinforce your company's message

Video testimonials are a great way to reinforce your company's message and make potential customers feel like they know you, your business, and your products.

When customers see another person saying good things about their service, it makes them more likely to trust and use that service themselves. Video testimonials can help you reach a larger audience by being shared on social media, review sites, and other marketing channels.

If you want to build trust with your audience, having real people talk about their experiences in using your products is a great way to do it. Video testimonials can help you get more customers by showing them that other people have had good experiences with your product and that it does what it says it does. They can also help you sell more because when someone sees someone else saying how much they love a product, they will think "hey, maybe I should try this too."

### Video testimonials are more authentic and believable than written ones

Of course, written testimonials are still a great way to get your message across. However, video testimonials have some distinct advantages that make them more effective.

Consider this: Your prospective customer is going to be much more likely to click on the “read more” link in a written testimonial than they would be if you presented the same information in video form. That's because videos are more memorable and emotional than text; they're also more authentic and believable.

### Video testimonials help build relationships

As you know, there are lots of ways to market your business. But video testimonials are the most effective way to build relationships with your clients and prospects. Why? Because they're personal, they allow you to showcase the client's experience with your company, and they're easy for people to share on social media!

If you haven't done so already, we highly recommend that you start gathering video testimonials from all of your happy customers. This is a great way for them to tell their friends about their experience with your company, as well as an opportunity for them to see how other people like them were helped by working with you in the past.

### Making a video with your clients is great for marketing

Making a video with your clients is great for marketing.

Video testimonials are one of the most effective ways to grow your business, and here's why:

* They help convert more customers by showing off your different services
* They build trust with potential new customers through personal stories about how you helped them or their family/friends (which can be shared on social media platforms)

They're easy to share via email, text message, and social media sites like Facebook or Twitter

## Conclusion

We hope that this information has helped you understand the importance of video testimonials and why they can be such a beneficial marketing tool. Video testimonials are an excellent way to engage with consumers, get them excited about your product or service, and ultimately sell more. So, if you haven't already started using them in your business, start today!
