## Part 4\. Does an audio interface improve sound quality?

 Most people were left to wonder whether or not an audio interface made any difference in the sound quality of their recordings. The answer is a resounding yes. An audio interface makes it easier to create better-sounding music, and the equipment is essential to recording high-quality music for distribution.

### What does “better audio quality” mean?

“A better audio quality” means you can understand people’s voices more clearly. A sound recorded or reproduced in such a way as to have improved clarity or intelligibility over existing recordings, or to provide greater depth of perception.” In other words, it describes an improvement.

Listening to someone speaking over the phone while trying to talk to them in person, their voice may sound garbled. Because noise surrounds the person’s mouth, creating a distortion in their voice that makes it impossible to decipher who is saying what.

### Which parameters determine “better audio quality”?

A microphone records sound waves, and digitization processes the sound waves and converts them into digital data called parameters. The main parameters include

**Sample Rate**

This is how many audio samples are being recorded per second. Frequency response is the response of a signal to the input. The higher the sample rate, the more information, and detail in the sound.

For example, 44100 (44.1kHz) samples per second are considered good quality.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![sample rate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/what-is-audio-interface-for-podcasting-2.jpg)

**Bit Depth**

Bit depth controls the dynamic range of the recording and measures how many bits of information can be recorded for each sample.

The lowest bit depth you should use for professional recordings is 16-bit, but many digital audio recorders offer up to 32-bit floating settings with a higher dynamic range.

## Part 3\. Is an audio interface a must for podcasters?

No, since without an audio interface, the recording could be done manually through other means. Therefore, the audio interface helps you record podcast episodes with better quality and higher fidelity, making it easier for listeners to hear your voice.

**This means an audio interface is not needed to record a podcast or voiceover but is recommended.** With any audio editing or recording, you must ensure that your audio interfaces work in tandem with your computer sound card.

### What types of recording setups require an audio interface?

For example, record an acoustic guitar to hear the difference between the various pickup types (strings, bridge, neck, etc.).

You can’t do this without an audio interface. Or, If you plan on making music or mixing audio, you’ll need an audio interface; in addition, those who work within bigger setups to make professional-looking audio give you all the tools necessary to process, mix and master your audio files.

## Part 4\. Does an audio interface improve sound quality?

 Most people were left to wonder whether or not an audio interface made any difference in the sound quality of their recordings. The answer is a resounding yes. An audio interface makes it easier to create better-sounding music, and the equipment is essential to recording high-quality music for distribution.

### What does “better audio quality” mean?

“A better audio quality” means you can understand people’s voices more clearly. A sound recorded or reproduced in such a way as to have improved clarity or intelligibility over existing recordings, or to provide greater depth of perception.” In other words, it describes an improvement.

Listening to someone speaking over the phone while trying to talk to them in person, their voice may sound garbled. Because noise surrounds the person’s mouth, creating a distortion in their voice that makes it impossible to decipher who is saying what.

### Which parameters determine “better audio quality”?

A microphone records sound waves, and digitization processes the sound waves and converts them into digital data called parameters. The main parameters include

**Sample Rate**

This is how many audio samples are being recorded per second. Frequency response is the response of a signal to the input. The higher the sample rate, the more information, and detail in the sound.

For example, 44100 (44.1kHz) samples per second are considered good quality.

![sample rate](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/what-is-audio-interface-for-podcasting-2.jpg)

**Bit Depth**

Bit depth controls the dynamic range of the recording and measures how many bits of information can be recorded for each sample.

The lowest bit depth you should use for professional recordings is 16-bit, but many digital audio recorders offer up to 32-bit floating settings with a higher dynamic range.

## Part 6\. Additional essential podcasting equipment for a podcast show

Most people aren’t aware that so much more equipment is required to put on a podcast than simply a microphone. Whether audio-recording software or a mixing board, many pieces of equipment are necessary to produce quality audio and video content. Here are the most important equipment needed to create a good podcast.

### Microphone and Stand

![microphone and stand](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/what-is-audio-interface-for-podcasting-7.jpg)

One of the first things you need to get started podcasting is a good microphone, and a quality tripod stands for it. When you’re recording podcasts, you want to ensure you’re getting the best sound. To do so, you need a high-quality microphone that should be durable yet comfortable.

The microphone stand is also one of the essential pieces of audio equipment, as it is used to hold the mic in an optimal position to ensure that the sound quality is at its best.

Headphones are required if you want to listen to podcasts during your commute. And the best ones for you depend on what kind of audio quality you prefer. A good pair of headphones will last you a long time. They are either wired or wireless; we recommend choosing wired over wireless because they offer low latency and are cheaper than wireless.

### Sound Card

![sound-card](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/what-is-audio-interface-for-podcasting-10.jpg)

Sound cards are vital tools in podcast production. They offer two key features: quality audio and plug-and-play compatibility. A good sound card will have some form of digital audio output, such as optical or USB, allowing your sound card to feed recorded audio to any device, regardless of brand.

### Recording and editing software

Audio editing and recording are essential for every podcaster, whether you record in your living room or on the road. If you’re producing audio for a podcast show, you’ll want to find a quality audio editing program to help you create compelling shows with consistent results.

The main reason is that podcasts are usually recorded on the go, which means the software must be easy to use, reliable and intuitive. So if you’re looking for reliable podcast software, look no further than Wondershare Filmora.
