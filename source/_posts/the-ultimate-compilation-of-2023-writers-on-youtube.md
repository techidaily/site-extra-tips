## Part I. 8 Storytelling YouTube Channels Best for You

One of the great ways to boost your video engagement is through storytelling. Here are some popular storytelling YouTubers who are all unique in their respective niche. Whether it's comedy, travel, or fashion, these channels will want you craving more!

![ted talk on storytelling](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/popular-youtube-storytelling-channels-2.jpg)

_**Subscriber Count: <17 million**_

TED or TED conference is a YouTube channel that promotes international content, whether on science, technology, culture, or academics. They invite the world's greatest minds to give their insight on a particular topic and tell a story to connect with a broader audience.

Videos on TED are usually posted daily; in this past month alone, they've shared more than 50 videos on their channel. What makes TED different is its story-driven narration. This is evident in their most viewed content, such as [Inside the mind of a master procrastinator - by Tim Urban](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU).

### 2) [Internet Historian](https://www.youtube.com/c/InternetHistorian/featured)

This is apparent in his latest video, "[Man in Cave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip9VGZeqMfo)," which makes the viewer guess what will happen next.
