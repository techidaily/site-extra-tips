If you are a true action camera lover and use to spend most of your time on development of breathtaking shots, then SJ4000 accessories can definitely help you. The article below contains some basic details about SJ4000 must have accessories. Some of you might feel already satisfied with the available set of accessories, whereas many adventure sports lovers are ready to buy things from market.

 2\. It is good to think about price range of your device. There are thousands of products available online and their cost fall within affordable figures.

![xiaomi power bank ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/xiaomi-power-bank.jpg)

 Action cameras are preferably used by professionals for long hour recording needs but their batteries have limited service hours.
