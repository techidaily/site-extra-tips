## Annual Reveal - Best FREE LUTs with Direct Access Links

As a kind of effect LUTs can be added to your photos or videos to enhance them. There are many different LUTs, and each one does its specific task. Today we will discuss the **top ten** most usually used **LUTs** with their functions and **free download links**. Let's start!

## Part 1\. Why should we use preset LUTs?

In addition to supporting a video to connect with audiences and emphasize the plot, color is also the most natural method for viewers to perceive a piece of media. A movie's aesthetic potential will be severely constrained if it only uses original camera footage. Every video producer has to be able to accurately comprehend the emotional qualities of color in order to adapt to the specific color theme of the movie. However, a beginner frequently doesn't know where to start when attempting color correction and color mixing for the first time. Color rings and color curves seem to be professional-level tools that are far beyond their reach. This time, a pre-set LUTs package will precisely solve the problem.
