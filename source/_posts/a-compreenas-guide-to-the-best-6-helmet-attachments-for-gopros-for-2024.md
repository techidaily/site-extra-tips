Helmet mount is the coolest way to make the most out of your action camera and there are many ways in which the camera and mic can be mounted on the helmet. So I also provide you details on how to **mount GoPro to helmet**.

![ Gopro flat curved mounts ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/gopro-flat-curved-mounts.jpg)

These are basic GoPro Mounts, which can be easily mounted to any curved or flat surface so that your action camera is properly mounted at that spot.
