## Part 2 Record audio on PowerPoint

We all know that PowerPoint is an excellent tool for creating amazing PPTs, provided you know everything creative about the device.

One of its creativity we're going to unleash in the form of learning how to record audio on PowerPoint is as follows.

Your PC must have a microphone, sound card, and speakers to record and hear any audio.

##### Step1 Design your PowerPoint

TIP: Use images and limit text to engage viewers/listeners better.

##### Step2 Hit the Slide Show tab

NOTE: Do not include Audio under Insert and Record Audio since it doesn't synchronize timings to automatically move the slides with the Audio.

![click slideshow tab ppt](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/click-slideshow-tab-ppt.jpg)

##### Step3 Hit the Record Slide Show

NOTE: Audio may begin getting recorded on its own if you are working on the older version of PowerPoint. It may still work, but this version offers reduced functionality.

##### Step4 Choose Record from Beginning or REcord from Current Slide based upon your requirements

NOTE: You can re-record the PowerPoint slides by hitting the Record Slide Show and Selecting Record from the Current Slide.

![record from current slide ppt](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/record-from-current-slide-ppt.jpg)

##### Step5 Hit the Record tab to begin recording narration

NOTE: PowerPoint will offer a three-second countdown before it begins recording.

##### Step6 Record narration and avoid reading text on the slide-out loud to viewers. Hit the blue Replay tab to listen to the recorded Audio and make sure that it got properly recorded

Hit the Advance tab that reads Advance to the following animation or slides to record the narration for the next slide. However, you need to make sure to stop talking while doing this.

##### Step7 Hit the 'X' or the Escape button present in the top right panel after recording the Audio. You will notice a speaker icon on slides with Audio over it

Save the video by hitting the File tab.

Select Export to confirm.

## Part 3 Adjust audio on PowerPoint
