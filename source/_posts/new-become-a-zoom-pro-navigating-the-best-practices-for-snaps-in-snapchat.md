**Hands-Free Recording** – You generally shoot Snapchat video by holding the camera button. Therefore, one hand always stays engaged. However, you can capture Snapchat video hands-free by creative Gesture from Assistive Touch.

**Record Video with External Music –** Snapchat has a wide range of music to add to your videos. However, you may not find the latest ones there. In such a case, if you want to add the latest song to your video, you should play the song on any music app you have. Thereafter, open Snapchat and start shooting the video. The background song from the music app will be recorded in your Snapchat video. All you have to do is time the video perfectly so that the song can sync with your video.

**Send Video Without Any Sound** – If you want to record a short video on Snapchat and send it across to your friends without the audio part or any sound, you can do it instantly.
