## Conclusion

On its own After Effects comes with so many post-production effects and features to make your project appear professional and well made. But if you would like to have a unique video production that stands head and shoulders above all others, plugins are a great way to do that. The good news is that After Effects allows for the use of plugins developed by third-party developers and some of the them like the text plugins, we have listed above can be very useful to a video’s production.
