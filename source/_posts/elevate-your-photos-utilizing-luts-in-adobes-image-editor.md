## How to Use LUTs in Photoshop

A Look Up Table (LUT) refers to a preset value of color calibrations you use in post-production. Some of the reasons for using LUTs include:

* Shorten your color grading time.
* Provide a base to develop your unique style.
* Quickly add color effects to your fast-turnaround videos.

You can use Adobe Photoshop CC to apply LUTs to your creation with ease. Additionally, it comes with preset LUTs to help you achieve a variety of color outcomes. For example, there are plenty of LUTs to give your image an artistic look, as if it was a painting. Additionally, you can use the program on both Windows and Mac devices, including handheld macOS devices.

With the basics out of the way, here is how to use LUTs in Photoshop:

#### 1\. Load your image to the workspace

You can load your photos directly from the program or launch them from your device. The most recent versions of the program store your media on the cloud.

#### 2\. Open the Color Lookup tool

The Color Lookup tool allows you to apply preset and custom LUTs to your image. Below is how to access it.

* Proceed to the Adjustments Panel and click Color Lookup from the dropdown menu. You will find this as the next option after Libraries, on the right side of your workspace. Most editions of Adobe Photoshop CC use a grid icon to represent Color Lookup.
* Alternatively, you may access Color Lookup from the Layers panel. Navigate to the bottom-right corner of your workspace and click the half-shaded icon. Then, select the Color Lookup option from the menu.

#### 3\. Loading your LUT in Photoshop CC

Once the Color Lookup tool is active, select the option Load 3D LUT to activate the dropdown menu. All your LUT presets will appear on the list, each with a different effect. You can also use custom LUTs in Photoshop CC. Here is how you access them.

* Click the Load 3D LUT entry from the dropdown menu. The program will open the File Explorer window that allows you to navigate directories on your device.
* Navigate to the directory that contains your custom luts photoshop, and select the one you need.
* Finally, click on Ok on the File Explorer window to complete the process.
* Make adjustments to your LUT in Photoshop CC.

Preset and custom LUTs may not give you the finish you anticipate. As such, you may need to make adjustments. Some of the adjustments you can make include:

* Color blending.
* Luminosity.
* Opacity.
* Saturation.
* Hues.

On the right side of your workspace is the Layers panel. It includes all the tools you need to edit your LUT. Remember, you need an Adjustment Layer to make changes to your LUTs. Additionally, you can save and export your custom LUTs for use across other video editing programs like Filmora.

## How to Use LUTs in Photoshop

A Look Up Table (LUT) refers to a preset value of color calibrations you use in post-production. Some of the reasons for using LUTs include:

* Shorten your color grading time.
* Provide a base to develop your unique style.
* Quickly add color effects to your fast-turnaround videos.

You can use Adobe Photoshop CC to apply LUTs to your creation with ease. Additionally, it comes with preset LUTs to help you achieve a variety of color outcomes. For example, there are plenty of LUTs to give your image an artistic look, as if it was a painting. Additionally, you can use the program on both Windows and Mac devices, including handheld macOS devices.

With the basics out of the way, here is how to use LUTs in Photoshop:

#### 1\. Load your image to the workspace

You can load your photos directly from the program or launch them from your device. The most recent versions of the program store your media on the cloud.

#### 2\. Open the Color Lookup tool

The Color Lookup tool allows you to apply preset and custom LUTs to your image. Below is how to access it.

* Proceed to the Adjustments Panel and click Color Lookup from the dropdown menu. You will find this as the next option after Libraries, on the right side of your workspace. Most editions of Adobe Photoshop CC use a grid icon to represent Color Lookup.
* Alternatively, you may access Color Lookup from the Layers panel. Navigate to the bottom-right corner of your workspace and click the half-shaded icon. Then, select the Color Lookup option from the menu.

#### 3\. Loading your LUT in Photoshop CC

Once the Color Lookup tool is active, select the option Load 3D LUT to activate the dropdown menu. All your LUT presets will appear on the list, each with a different effect. You can also use custom LUTs in Photoshop CC. Here is how you access them.

* Click the Load 3D LUT entry from the dropdown menu. The program will open the File Explorer window that allows you to navigate directories on your device.
* Navigate to the directory that contains your custom luts photoshop, and select the one you need.
* Finally, click on Ok on the File Explorer window to complete the process.
* Make adjustments to your LUT in Photoshop CC.

Preset and custom LUTs may not give you the finish you anticipate. As such, you may need to make adjustments. Some of the adjustments you can make include:

* Color blending.
* Luminosity.
* Opacity.
* Saturation.
* Hues.

On the right side of your workspace is the Layers panel. It includes all the tools you need to edit your LUT. Remember, you need an Adjustment Layer to make changes to your LUTs. Additionally, you can save and export your custom LUTs for use across other video editing programs like Filmora.
