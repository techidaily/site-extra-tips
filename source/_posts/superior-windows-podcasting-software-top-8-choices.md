## What to look for a podcast app for pc?

Now that we have looked over the best podcast apps for PC, it's about time to choose the best one for you. To make it easy to decide, you will ask yourself the following questions.

**1\. Is the app available for multiple devices?**

An app can be great, but does it support multiple devices? You will need to keep in mind if you are using your PC to browse for Podcast, will you be able to browse it on your phone too? A sync-to-cloud service allows the users to access podcasts from multiple devices, so you need to keep that in mind.

**2\. Can the podcast show be found in the app?**

Yes, you want to listen to podcasts, but what kind of podcasts do you want to listen to? Does the app you are searching for host your desired podcast show, channel, or even artist? The answer to these questions will allow you to choose the best podcast app.

**3\. Does the app have a user-friendly UI?**

Having a reasonable podcast app means the user can browse the library quickly, with short and straightforward content. A user-friendly UI enables you to work with more efficiency and save time.

Moreover, an interactive UI makes the experience more pleasing, and designers keep this in mind because the UI is the first thing a user will notice when they open the app. So a good UI may also mean the developers have kept a keen eye on designing the app.

**4\. What is the cost value?**

According to the users' complaints, one of the significant raised concerns is the cost of premium access to the app. You will be laden with ads from over the UI if not bought, which may interrupt a smooth experience.

So to hide those ads, a premium plan will allow you to remove these ads and make your browsing much smoother. Moreover, a premium plan will allow you to access the vast services that come exclusively with the plan.

## What to look for a podcast app for pc?

Now that we have looked over the best podcast apps for PC, it's about time to choose the best one for you. To make it easy to decide, you will ask yourself the following questions.

**1\. Is the app available for multiple devices?**

An app can be great, but does it support multiple devices? You will need to keep in mind if you are using your PC to browse for Podcast, will you be able to browse it on your phone too? A sync-to-cloud service allows the users to access podcasts from multiple devices, so you need to keep that in mind.

**2\. Can the podcast show be found in the app?**

Yes, you want to listen to podcasts, but what kind of podcasts do you want to listen to? Does the app you are searching for host your desired podcast show, channel, or even artist? The answer to these questions will allow you to choose the best podcast app.

**3\. Does the app have a user-friendly UI?**

Having a reasonable podcast app means the user can browse the library quickly, with short and straightforward content. A user-friendly UI enables you to work with more efficiency and save time.

Moreover, an interactive UI makes the experience more pleasing, and designers keep this in mind because the UI is the first thing a user will notice when they open the app. So a good UI may also mean the developers have kept a keen eye on designing the app.

**4\. What is the cost value?**

According to the users' complaints, one of the significant raised concerns is the cost of premium access to the app. You will be laden with ads from over the UI if not bought, which may interrupt a smooth experience.

So to hide those ads, a premium plan will allow you to remove these ads and make your browsing much smoother. Moreover, a premium plan will allow you to access the vast services that come exclusively with the plan.

## Final words

Listening to podcasts is a worldwide trend nowadays. Watching a podcast requires you to sit on a couch. But a good podcast app allows you to listen while in a car, on a train, at home, or even working out.

Various podcast apps will allow you to explore the world of audio media with various interests and shows. Following the guide mentioned above, you can now select the Windows podcast app easily that suits you the best.
