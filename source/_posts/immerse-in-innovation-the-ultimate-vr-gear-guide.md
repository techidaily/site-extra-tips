## 1\. VR controllers

 Many companies have released different types of VR controllers which are being used by the gamers as well. Let’s have a look on some of them.

* Mogo Pro Controller

 It is a very famous VR controller gamepad which is compatible with iOS, android and also windows phone. It is very comfortable for the long play sessions. A very long battery life and also rubberized grips make it even more special. It has a retail average price $49.99\. It is available online and in high street retail.

## 2\. VR Bikes

 Virtual reality can help you to enjoy the best biking experience of your life. Here are some of the products you might want to experience once.

* VirZoom

 The VirZoom has a unique apartment-friendly magnitude, but it still priced at $399.95 only, on balance with some other home fitness apparatuses. Along with a headset and also a computer capable of using it, however, that ticket could be as costly as $1500\. That is a very big asset for the customers whose Wii Fit is more likely gathering dirt at the house of their parents. Fortunately, Honey man says a gymnasium form of VirZoom will also be ready in the year 2017.

* Widerun virtual biking

 Visualize yourself biking in the city of San Francisco in the bay, on the Olympic racing track as well, and on the snowy trail on the Alps, and in any city as well around the world! You will surely be reluctant to get off the bike is you can bike in these cool sites virtually! This is the virtual reality and the augmented reality in its best form! Good work was done by Widerun! It is as costly as about $370 and it started shipping in April 2016.

## 3\. VR Treadmills

 Virtual reality treadmills and gloves are changing the life of people to another level. You can now do exercise in virtual reality running on beautiful sites all over the world. Let’s have a look on some of the products.

* Cyberith Virtualizer

 A lighter and extra gorgeous option. The stage here is less immense, and phases are pursued by gesture sensors. Squatting actions can be achieved more ordinary due to the option to lean on one knee, deprived of endangering to hurt it. The construction itself is more moveable, which makes it more beautiful, particularly in view of its proportions. Although its official price is unknown yet because mass production of this product has not been started yet.

## 4\. VR Gloves

* Manus VR gloves

 You can play using these as you would play with a controller but you are not holding the controller which improves to the engagement. There is a real hand existence, you truly feel like it is your hand instead of you governing a digital hand if there is any sense in it. A pair of washable gloves cost as much as $250 and its battery timing is about 8 hours.
