In some cases, a couple of additional items might be needed such as ceramic disc magnet, neodymium magnet, some pieces of Velcro, big rubber band and at least 45 mm lenses.

### 2.How to assemble accessories

* Download the compressed [template folder from Google](https://vr.google.com/intl/en%5Fus/cardboard/get-cardboard/  ).
* Print the design files you want.
* Cut the design and glue it on the cardboard.
* Assemble the Google cardboard.

* Get now a rubber band to avoid sliding out of your smartphone from the Google cardboard.
* If necessary, affix the NFC tag to the cardboard.
