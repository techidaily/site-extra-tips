## Part 1: Does the SRT file work on a Mac?

The SRT file is typically a plain text-based file with time markers, sequence numbers, and captions. Most third-party media players do showcase the SRT-based format easily. So, you can also use Preview apps or any other software to access and read the basic text documents on Mac.

However, the QuickTime player on Mac does not always support SRT in videos. You have to convert them to a format the QuickTime Player supports or utilize a third-party **SRT editor Mac** allows.

## Part 3: The Best Way to Edit .SRT Files for Videos on Mac

While all of the solutions given in Part 2 allow you to access SRT files on Mac, the editing benefits are limited. Instead, you can opt for an efficient video editing software like Filmora if you are wondering **how to create SRT file on Mac** and then edit it. The software supports SRT files for viewing, formatting, editing, and more.

**What is Filmora?**

The software comes with various standard-level and advanced editing functions, including speech-to-text for voiceover-based transcriptions into the video. Moreover, you can use the preset effects, including Boris FX/NewBlue FX (on certain Mac devices only), to further optimize video quality. Not only the video, but you can also edit the audio playback, voiceovers, and edit SRT files here.
