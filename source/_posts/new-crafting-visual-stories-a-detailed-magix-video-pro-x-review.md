## MAGIX Video Pro X Review

The top-tier video editing program from the European-based MAGIX corporation is called MAGIX Video Pro X. It's crucial to know where MAGIX Video Pro X fits within the larger world of video editing software before writing a review of it.

![magix video pro x](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/magix-video-pro-x.jpg)

The professional grade editing and post-production software Video Pro X can work with all file types, from consumer to completely professional broadcast quality. Therefore, from the standpoint of a review, it is geared toward the advanced amateur, the aspirant professional, and the full-fledged professional.

As a result, it provides extensive color grading and correction, professional special effects, and postproduction tools. MAGIX Video Pro X is optimized to generate video, picture, and audio at broadcast studio quality and features a configurable user interface for a customized workflow.

With that said, letâ€™s start!

### User-friendly

Before you can access the main application for MAGIX Movie Edit Pro, you must first download the installer. In addition to this utility, it also tries to install several additional things, which we urge you to reject. After installation, you'll need to register in order to access the free trial if you haven't already purchased it. You will then receive an activation code. After that is finished, you can start.

As you learn how to use Movie Edit Pro, you might want to download the manual. Additionally, there is an introduction movie that is easily accessed from the help menu. More than 300 pages large and jam-packed with knowledge make up the guidebook. But not everyone wants to read a novel in order to understand how to operate a piece of software.

When we decided to use the opening video, a screen asking us to select our country appeared. Only South Africa, Australia, Australia, and the United Kingdom were available, though. A country selection screen with such a narrow focus has never been seen before.

Americans should not be concerned, despite the fact that they might not enjoy having to appear to be from a different country in order to view the accompanying materials as all of the links lead to the same collection of videos.

Ironically, the videos convey a vibe that is similar to 1980s American television. It doesn't matter if the narrator's instructions don't always match what is happening on screen.

Despite the peculiarity of the support material, there is a lot of it, making it easy to locate what you need. You may also click on specific screen elements to get a more in-depth description of them using the contextual help menu in MAGIX.

### Projects

There are various perspectives on projects. There includes a scene overview and a timeline in addition to the storyboard mode, which is the default. If you are comfortable with other tools, we advise choosing the timeline view. It is the most practical strategy and how we prefer to work.

You can quickly apply transitions and subtitles, as well as chop and move your clips from the timeline. Drag these items from the selection box to the appropriate clip, then change the settings as necessary to add them. You might need assistance becoming organized if you're working on your film alongside others. The best project management tools can aid in team coordination.

Movie Edit occasionally makes things more difficult than they need to be. It loses some points for that because for some reason it interferes with the print-screen button's typical operation, causing a superfluous pop-up to appear and frequently preventing screenshots from being taken.

Although there are UI peculiarities, we didn't really encounter any errors with its standard editing tools. Dragging transitions to the timeline appears to completely replace your movie, and on one instance, we were unable to undo it to return to the previous position.

It's not as simple as using other tools when you want to rearrange layers. It's simple to create and rearrange layers in most editors, but we struggled to do so here and encountered problems when we tried to apply effects to various portions of our film.

Additionally, we discovered that occasionally nothing happened after picking an item from the menu, which was typically connected to online or external services. Although the settings screens and menus appear overloaded and overpopulated with small writing, the UI is generally clear. Although simple operations are frequently unnecessarily convoluted, the controls are intuitive in the sense that you can identify what buttons perform.

While using Movie Edit Pro is generally simple, there are many errors. To get the most out of the product, we advise reading the manual and other assistance documents.

### Performance

Windows 7, 8, or 10 64-bit versions are required for Movie Edit Pro. A minimum 2.4 GHz processor, 4 GB of RAM, and a graphics card with 512 MB of memory are required.

We used our usual set of clips and settings to assess its rendering rates. Our test version had a license issue, so we were forced to output to the AVI format instead of the MPEG we usually use.

It also failed to generate our source clips at 60 frames per second. Our test system contains a 16GB memory stick, an Intel i5-7600 processor, and a 6GB graphics card. Storage is handled by an SSD.

Compared to HitFilm, their speeds are twice as rapid. Although Movie Edit Pro is slower than  Ultimate, the results are of considerably higher quality. Even though we were unable to produce at 60 frames per second, it still accomplishes what it can quickly. Even after upscaling to 1080p, the video quality of the output was good.

### File formats

Although not as extensive as  Ultimate, that is still a respectable array of formats. Despite having troubles with the MJPEG output, we produced very high-quality AVI videos for our tests. No importation difficulties were discovered.

### Resources

A few helpful functions are tucked away in the menus of Movie Edit Pro. You can find various extras that can enhance your output by going to "edit > wizards."

There is only one template available for choosing in the slideshow maker's template drop-down menu by default, so until you go to the store, you're stuck with "chillout." However, it's not required that you utilize a template. You may change a number of variables to personalize your presentation. There is an option for intensity, and you may select a music, as well as transitions and effects.

For us to use the soundtrack creator, we needed to install another module. You can make music in a number of styles and add "emotions" at particular places in your video, but we were unable to do this in our test version. If you can, however, you can do this.

Though, once more, we discovered that this didn't work for us right out of the box, Movie E dit Pro also features travel-route animation tools. When we attempted to use it, nothing happened.

A link to MAGIX Photo Designer is included in the menu of Movie Edit Pro, and you have the option of installing Music Maker alongside it. Although Music Maker is currently discounted from $99 to $99, Photo Designer is free. If you're interested in making images or music to go with your movies, these are both useful additions that you should consider.

The MAGIX Speed burnR program appears after selecting "share > backup to CD or DVD" from the menu. We hadn't previously seen this in the menus, but you can now burn to Blu-ray as well.

### Pricing

There are various software versions available for potential Movie Edit Pro owners to select from. For video editing software, the Pro edition costs at $69.99, while the Plus and Premium versions are priced at $99.99 and $129.00, respectively.

Extra transitions, templates, and effects are included in the Plus version. Additionally, it has extra features including direct editing, journey routes, and multicam and 360-degree editing. Additionally, the Premium version offers more effects.

You may sign up for a 30-day free trial without providing a credit card. Three-minute output videos are the only restriction on the trial version, but that's more than enough to test it out. However, when we attempted to export an MPEG video, a pop-up informed us that the code was not available owing to license restrictions.

Beware: after joining MAGIX, we received a ton of junk mail. But to be fair, it ceased after you unsubscribed.

There is an in-app store as well. This includes different add-ons including templates, transitions, and a large variety of opening and outro animations. Additional soundtracks, photos, and other visual goodies are also available for purchase.

### Support

The help menu offers a community contact option if you need immediate assistance. This approach provides you with a pop-up window to ask your inquiry without identifying the person you are asking. We wish to b e informed in advance whether our questions will be sent or placed someplace.

Through its help pop-up, we attempted to inquire about its peculiar print screen issue, but instead of entering a live chat, we were forwarded to its forum. Our search returned no results. Nevertheless, there are frequently responses to queries and in-depth discussions on the forum.

On the support website, you'll also find some helpful tutorial videos, as well as a media section showcasing users' works.

Fast and nearly instantaneous input response may be found in Movie Edit Pro. Despite not being as appealing at first glance, it has a more user-friendly design than some of its competitors. But with its more sophisticated functions, you can occasionally get yourself into trouble.

## Conclusion

Movie Edit Pro is the David Lynch of the video editing world. It is eccentric and a little strange, but it can do amazing things. There were several problems we encountered, but none of them prevented us from using the tool. It excels at the fundamentals and offers a ton of extras and effects. It performs considerably better.

It gives off the impression that it was created by enthusiastic individuals who care deeply about what they are doing yet aren't overly concerned with the competition. We would prefer Movie Edit Pro to HitFilm if it were free to edit videos quickly and easily for private use or a small YouTube audience. Having said that, for serious use, we favor HitFilm. Though there isn't much there, both tools are useful and enjoyable.

Movie Edit Pro frequently feels and looks archaic, yet it performs well when it matters. Once you've figured it out, working with it is simple. It also contains a ton of features, effects, and choices. Please share your thoughts in the comments if you've used this or any other video editors and have something to say about them.

Gratitude for reading.
