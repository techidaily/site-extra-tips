## Accelerating Video Success on YouTube for 100K+ Views

If you're looking to get more views on YouTube, it's important that your channel is set up for success. The better your channel is optimized for search and the more engaging content you have, the more likely your videos will be discovered by people who can share them.

## #1\. Pick a specific subject matter or topic

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![pick topic 100k views video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/pick-topic-100k-views-video.jpg)

You need to pick a specific subject matter or topic that you can talk about for a long time.

* If you are passionate about it, it will show and people will resonate with your passion.
* If you can talk about it in detail, people will be able to relate to the details and feel like they know what you're talking about (even if they don't).
* If it's not too broad, but also not too narrow, then people won't be scratching their heads trying to figure out what you mean by "inbound marketing" or "email marketing." They won't have a clue as to what those terms mean unless there's some context around them—and if there is no context around them at all, then chances are these things aren't exactly interesting enough yet for anyone else either!

## #2\. Don't worry about producing the highest quality video

![shoot high quality video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/shoot-high-quality-video.jpg)

Don't worry about producing the highest quality video. As long as you have a relevant and interesting topic, you can always improve the quality of your videos over time with more resources and equipment. Focus on creating content that is highly valuable to your audience and provides them with something they haven't seen before—not how pretty it looks.

## #3\. Post in related video communities to find an audience

![post video to community](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/post-video-to-community.jpg)

Once you've finished your video and uploaded it to YouTube, the next step is to post in related video communities. You can find these by searching for keywords related to your video or its topic, searching for the title of your own video (assuming that it's not too long), or doing a simple search on Google.

Once you find a relevant community, make sure that you're posting in the right place! Some communities may be specific about what kind of content they allow—for example, if someone makes a "How To" video about how to make an omelette, she probably shouldn't post it in "Gaming." Be sure that you're posting in the right category.

## #4\. Write keyword-rich titles and descriptions

![use seo skill in youtube video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/use-seo-skill-in-youtube-video.jpg)

The first step to getting more views is writing keyword-rich titles and descriptions. Keywords are important for search engines, which means they're also important for your video's ranking on YouTube. You want your videos to appear in the "top" (highest-ranked) results when someone searches for a certain topic or phrase.

A good way to get ranked high is by using keywords. Keywords will help you rank higher in YouTube searches, which means more people will see your video!

## #5\. Use annotations to link videos together

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![use animation to link videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/use-animation-to-link-videos.jpg)

Annotations are a great way to link videos together, or to link videos on your channel with other videos and resources. Here are some examples of things you can do with annotations:

* Link multiple channels together.
* Link YouTube videos from other channels.
* Link external sites that are relevant to your content (e.g., links to related blogs).
* Add additional resources for more information about the topic at hand (the most common example is using a URL shortener like bitly).

## #6\. Comment back on other people's videos in your niche

![comment other videos in your niche](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/comment-other-videos-in-your-niche.jpg)

Another way to get more views is by commenting on other people's videos. You should do this only if the video is in your niche and the channel has a lot of subscribers (over 1,000). When you comment, make sure that you engage with the creator and add value to the conversation. If they ask a question, answer it! If they want feedback, give them some! If they ask for help with something, offer advice or information. And if someone comments on one of your videos asking for help with something related to what you're talking about in your video—don't ignore them! Reply back right away so that people see that interaction on their newsfeeds and find out more about what you have to say about it.

This might seem like an obvious way to get more views but I've seen many creators who don't interact much with other channels because they think their audience won't care about what other people are doing or saying online. But getting involved in conversations with other creators in your niche will attract new viewers because:

* It shows that there's a level of trust between creators working together within communities; this makes viewers feel like there's an opportunity for collaboration as well (and hopefully future collaborations!).

## #7\. Upload at least one video per week and never skip a week

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![upload video to youtube regularly](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/upload-video-to-youtube-regularly.jpg)

To keep your audience coming back for more, upload at least one video per week and never skip a week. If you have trouble uploading that often, try to upload a video every two weeks or so. If that's not feasible, at least make sure you have one ready to go before the end of the month so you can post it before the next month begins.

To make sure that videos get uploaded regularly without hassle, put them on a schedule (e.g., Monday through Friday). This way, you know when each new video will come out so there's no stress about missing the deadline for getting it online in time for its scheduled release date.

The best way to ensure regularity is by setting up an automated scheduler with analytics services like Tubebuddy that will automatically publish your content while also keeping track of when each new episode goes live on YouTube and how many views each receives over time—helping predict what kind of clip is likely to be most popular among viewers based on past trends

## #8\. Add calls to action at the beginning of your video

![add call to action youtube video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/add-call-to-action-youtube-video.jpg)

* Tell viewers they can subscribe to your channel.
* Ask them to like or comment on the video.
* Ask them to share the video with their friends. This is a great way to increase traffic, especially if you have a small audience right now.
* Encourage viewers to visit your website, or any other product or service that you offer as part of your channel's brand (if applicable).

## #9\. Fill your channel with useful information, not just marketing messages

![fill youtube channel with useful info](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/fill-youtube-channel-with-useful-info.jpg)

One of the most common mistakes that people make when creating YouTube videos is focusing too much on themselves, their business and the products or services they sell. While this may be important for those who are looking to sell a product or service—and these types of things should definitely be mentioned at some point in your video—the majority of your viewers are not going to want to hear about how great you are.

If you want to grow an audience on YouTube and get more views, then one thing you need to do is provide value. This could mean sharing tips and tricks, answering questions from viewers or promoting other channels that produce great content related to your niche (which will encourage them share it with their friends).

## #10\. Use playlists effectively to get more views

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![create playlist for youtube videos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/create-playlist-for-youtube-videos.jpg)

Playlists are a great way to get more views for your YouTube videos. They allow you to group together related videos, making it easier for viewers to find what they're looking for and watch more of your content. They also help in the search engine optimization (SEO) of those videos!

If you're looking to create a series of videos, playlists are an ideal way to do so. You could create one playlist with all the episodes of your new show, or have separate playlists for each episode so people can binge-watch them all at once if they want to.

Playlists can also be used as a place where viewers can watch related content that isn't necessarily part of another video—for example if someone just really likes one thing from one video but would like other similar things too (like say music from several artists).

## The Bottom Line

We hope this post has helped you get more views for your YouTube videos! If you follow these steps, we promise that your channel will be full of high-quality content in no time. Remember to take it slow and don't try to do everything at once. The most important thing is to stick with it - if you keep uploading videos every week and posting comments back on other people's channels (and interacting with commenters), then an audience will come along eventually.
