## Part 1: A podcast checklist before podcasting

Podcasting is not a cost-money thing compared to starting a YouTube channel. Here is a to-do list for a successful podcast channel. We've also indicated the ones that require money and the ones that do not.

| **Checklist**                       | **Need Money or Not** |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Plan Your Podcast                   | No                    |
| Create A Podcast Brand              | No                    |
| Setup Your Equipment                | Yes                   |
| Choose Your Recording Software      | Yes                   |
| Prepare for Your Podcast Recordings | No                    |
| Record A Few First Episodes         | No                    |
| Edit Your Podcast Recordings        | No                    |
| Publish Your Podcast Show           | Yes, the hosting fee  |
| Promote & Monetize Your Podcast     | Yes, Marketing        |

Only a few things on the podcast checklist in the table above require you to spend money. But the good news is that you don't necessarily need to spend on hosting fees and marketing when you're just starting a podcast. Instead, you can stick with the basics like a microphone, computer, and recording software for a start. Then, later on, you can invest extra money for things like marketing and improved hosting.

That said, proceed to find out how much it'll cost to invest in the basic things you need to start a podcast based on different budget packages that suit your needs.

## Part 2: The Best Value Budget Package

After reviewing different podcast tools in the market, we got to find out how much it would cost to acquire a quality microphone, computer (if you don't have one), and lots more for a podcast without taking too much toll off your budget.

The table below is an estimated value of how much you could purchase different podcast tools. However, remember that these values are based on the current market pricing. We'll share more knowledge on the specific brands we believe for your need later.

| **est Value Budget Package**       |                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Equipment**                      | **Range of Budget**                    |
| **Microphone Pack**                | $50 - $100                             |
| **Computer**                       | Free (if you already have one) to $500 |
| **Recording and Editing Software** | $50                                    |
| **Pop filter or Windscreen**       | $10 - $50                              |
| **Cables**                         | $50                                    |
| **Shock Mount**                    | $30                                    |
| **Headphones**                     | $50 - $150                             |
| **Total Amount**                   | $240 - $290                            |

Part 1: A podcast checklist before podcasting

Podcasting is not a cost-money thing compared to starting a YouTube channel. Here is a to-do list for a successful podcast channel. We've also indicated the ones that require money and the ones that do not.

| **Checklist**                       | **Need Money or Not** |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Plan Your Podcast                   | No                    |
| Create A Podcast Brand              | No                    |
| Setup Your Equipment                | Yes                   |
| Choose Your Recording Software      | Yes                   |
| Prepare for Your Podcast Recordings | No                    |
| Record A Few First Episodes         | No                    |
| Edit Your Podcast Recordings        | No                    |
