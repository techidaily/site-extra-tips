## Illuminating the World of Photography with Adobe's HDR Techniques

Lightroom is certain one of the best HDR software for all levels of photographers. Whether it's your first time creating an HDR merge or you simply want to take advantage of the speed and accuracy that this software provides, using Lightroom HDR is a far more powerful and pleasant [desktop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom.html), [mobile](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-lightroom/mobile.html), and [web](https://lightroom.adobe.com/) compatible tool to create awesome high dynamic range photos.

## How to Create HDR Images in Lightroom?

You can use **Lightroom HDR** to properly balance images and provide high dynamic range and color vibrancy in pictures and videos. You can get high-quality images with no ghosting or bad alignment in the finished files and get enhanced visibility. In addition, features like **Lightroom Enfuse** are available for further editing.

**How to get high dynamic range photos with Lightroom?**

Step1Open the Lightroom software and right-click on the menu. On Mac PCs, press Ctrl + Mac icon.

Step2Hover your cursor on top of the “**Photo Merge**” option. From the drop-down menu, choose HDR.

Step3When the subsequent window loads in some time, tap the check mark beside the Auto Align option. All images will rearrange in an ordered sequence.

![tap the check mark](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/create-and-merge-stunning-hdr-images-in-lightroom-1.jpg)

Step4Click on the Auto Tone feature to get shadow and highlight-related detailing.

Step5Adjust the Deghosting quantity from None to Medium or High.

![adjust the deghosting quantity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/create-and-merge-stunning-hdr-images-in-lightroom-2.jpg)

Step6Press Merge to export the HDR image. It will create one RAW file.

Step7Access the Develop module for further editing to the standard image file, changing elements like White/Black points, Exposure, and Vibrance settings.

Step8Finally, save the file.

## How to Use HDR Merge in Lightroom?

It is straightforward and usable for people to use the Lightroom HDR Merge function to add multiple images into a stack and prepare HDRs. The steps for that are simple to carry out, but you need to upgrade your software to the latest version first for the best results.

**How to perform HDR merge with Lightroom?**

Step1Open the Lightroom Classic software and control-click/CMD all pictures you want to merge.

Step2Click on Photo > Photo Merge. Then, choose the HDR option.

Alternatively, you can press the Ctrl and H keys on your keyboard.

![click on photo and photo merge](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/create-and-merge-stunning-hdr-images-in-lightroom-3.jpg)

Step3When the HDR Merge Preview box opens, click the tick boxes beside Auto Tone and Auto Align to OFF. This is only if necessary, so see the previewed images to decide if you want to keep the default settings or not.

Step4In some of the exposure-bracketed pictures that merge, there are patches of semi-transparent spots in the HDR image. To avoid this, you can adjust deghosting between None and High, based on how many of the different artifacts you want to remove.

![deghosting between none and high](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/create-and-merge-stunning-hdr-images-in-lightroom-4.jpg)

Step5Preview all changes and make further adjustments, if necessary.

Step6After the merging takes place, click on the Create Stack choice to group multiple exposure-bracketed images. After you do so, the HDR image will appear at the front position of the stacked images.

![click on the create stack choice](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/create-and-merge-stunning-hdr-images-in-lightroom-5.jpg)

Step7Click the Merge button to save the HDR photo as a .dng image file.

## Is Lightroom or Photoshop better for HDR?

Both Photoshop and Lightroom are suitable solutions for different improvements to image processing quality. But there are variations between these two Adobe productions.

### Lightroom has many editing pre-sets

To note, many **HDR Lightroom presets** are available for more accessible editing work, like merging images after selecting multiple shots in the Library grid view. You can right-click on top of the chosen pictures and edit them in the HDR Pro (Photoshop) platforms. It will automatically begin the merging process.

### Lightroom merges in HDR Raw format

However, while Photoshop HDR Pro is notable for HDR-centric editing and merging, Lightroom allows users to merge the RAW files in the software into HDR RAW files. So, photographers using **Lightroom HDR merge** can customize the images better and provide higher dynamic range quality with no formatting change. On the other hand, Photoshop allows Photoshop PSD file type merging mainly.

### Photoshop HDR Pro offers 8-bit/16-bit/32-bit file options

The Photoshop HDR Pro version allows 8-bit/16-bit files. You can change them to 32-bit files by tapping the top-right section of this software window. Here, you can use the setting “Complete Toning in Adobe Raw” instead of operating the standard HDR editor controls. You can also control the ghosting mode here.

### Photoshop vs. Lightroom Deghosting feature

On the other hand, features like **Lightroom bracketing** make it a suitable choice for photo editing. The HDR Merge Preview allows users to see the chosen images before any processing is started. The default settings for Deghost Amount, Auto Tone, and Auto Align are ticked, with the Deghost choice set as None.

After making any changes, you can tap the Merge button to complete the whole process. Lightroom automatically saves the image you merge in 32-bit .dng file format, adding a suffix-HDR to the file's name. You can edit the standard file in the Develop environment later.

So, in terms of 32-bit processing, both products are helpful, but customization options are more with Photoshop.

**Pros & Cons for Lightroom HDR**

Pros

* Automatically saves image files in 32.bit DNG format.
* Better learning curve compared to the Photoshop HDR Pro version.
* Easy load multiple bracketing images to do **Lightroom HDR merge** via the Library.

Cons

* Does not include 8 and 16-bit options as default.
* Blurry images are still possible after processing.

**Pros & Cons for Photoshop HDR Pro**

Pros

* No stand-alone software is necessary to use this feature.
* More personalization benefits with 32-fit file editing.
* You can use both editing and tone mapping functions separately and get realistic image looks.

Cons

* More artifacts that require extra cleaning can appear if there are many moving objects visible in one scene.
* Beginners will struggle with this solution since it is relatively complex.
