In case of 4K recording that works at 100 Mbps you can use this camera up to 52 minutes without any trouble.</p><p> On the other side if we talk about storage of this device that we must say that it has worked pretty well on enhancement. The MicroSD port is available on backside behind the waterproof door along with a Micro HDMI port so that users can easily transfer their footage to big screen. Note that your Micro SD card must be of at least Class 4 rating if you wish to record MP4 footage. In case of XAVC S recording prefer to use MicroSDXC Class 10 cards or other product that can offer higher speed.</p><h2 id="Recommend-best-video-editing-software-for-action-camera-users"><a href="#Recommend-best-video-editing-software-for-action-camera-users" class="headerlink" title="Recommend best video editing software for action camera users"></a>Recommend best video editing software for action camera users</h2><p> If you want to take your video content to the next level with some video editing without being completely overwhelmed, you will definitely want to give Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor) a try.

The finer 4K details and added steadyshot image stabilization feature makes it really useful for athletes and other adventure sports lovers. The one thing where it still needs to improve is the chunky controls and atrocious menus. As GoPro hero is available with the same price tag so these little missing details can force buyers to follow the GoPro series again. There is no doubt to say that GoPro Hero4 Black offers wide range of accessories but after viewing all the updated features of Sony FDR-X1000 we can say that Sony is working in right direction. If you are in favour of flexibility and want to access the GPS tagging feature for your shoots then it is really good to go ahead with FDR-X1000.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/capturing-the-moment-advanced-tips-for-iphone-silhouettes/"><u>Capturing the Moment  Advanced Tips for iPhone Silhouettes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/best-buys-detailed-analysis-of-top-6-hdmi-monitors-for-2024/"><u>Best Buys  Detailed Analysis of Top 6 HDMI Monitors for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/in-2024-blurry-photos-top-tools-reviewed/"><u>In 2024, Blurry Photos  Top Tools Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/unmask-the-tricks-of-photo-and-video-upload-in-win11/"><u>Unmask the Tricks of Photo & Video Upload in Win11</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/from-creator-to-consumer-securing-a-spot-on-apples-listings/"><u>From Creator to Consumer  Securing a Spot on Apple’s Listings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/ultimate-online-livestream-technology/"><u>Ultimate Online Livestream Technology</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/next-gen-gaming-horizon-upcoming-bests-in-playstation-vr/"><u>Next-Gen Gaming Horizon  Upcoming Bests in PlayStation VR</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/new-best-8-sbt-to-srtr-conversion-tools-pcmac-compatibility/"><u>[New] Best 8 SBT to SRTR Conversion Tools - PC/Mac Compatibility</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-secrets-of-facebooks-timely-content-no-spending-max-gain/"><u>[New] In 2024, Secrets of Facebook's Timely Content - No Spending, Max Gain</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-process-of-screen-sharing-samsung-galaxy-a15-4g-to-pc-detailed-steps-drfone-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Process of Screen Sharing Samsung Galaxy A15 4G to PC- Detailed Steps | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-10-leading-flv-to-youtube-video-converters/"><u>[New] In 2024, 10 Leading FLV to YouTube Video Converters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-life360-circle-everything-you-need-to-know-on-asus-rog-phone-8-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Life360 Circle Everything You Need to Know On Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-files.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-refreshing-mistake-on-tiktok-what-happens/"><u>[New] In 2024, Refreshing Mistake on TikTok – What Happens?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/app-wont-open-on-your-poco-c50-here-are-all-fixes-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>App Wont Open on Your Poco C50?

So, keep reading.</p><ol><li><a href="#part4-1">Method 1: Create an RSS feed with hosting platforms</a></li><li><a href="#part4-2">Method 2: Create an RSS feed without a hosting platform</a></li><li><a href="#part4-3">Method 3: Create your own exclusive RSS feed</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part5">Hot FAQs on Podcast RSS Feeds</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-an-Podcast-RSS-Feed"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-an-Podcast-RSS-Feed" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is an Podcast RSS Feed?"></a>Part 1. What Is an Podcast RSS Feed?</h2><p>RSS, Really Simple Syndication, has been around for quite a long time (since 1999), and it was introduced to allow internet users to stay connected with their favorite websites. In other words, it’s used to subscribe to news websites, emails, blogs, podcasts, etc. It is just a simple link looking like this:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-1.jpg"                      alt="rss feed"                ></p><p>Your Podcast RSS feed makes the information about your podcast quickly accessible on various podcast directories, like Apple Podcast and Spotify. Yes, it holds the information about your podcast show and its episodes. So, whenever you create a new episode on the hosting website, it automatically updates it to podcast directories in real-time, thus making it accessible to listeners at their convenience.</p><p>Ultimately, an RSS feed saves you the stress of manually uploading new episodes of your podcast to various platforms! An RSS feed could also be referred to as;</p><ul><li>RSS channel</li><li>Newsfeed</li><li>RSS stream</li><li>Web feed</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-When-to-Use-an-RSS-Feed"><a href="#Part-2-When-to-Use-an-RSS-Feed" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. When to Use an RSS Feed"></a>Part 2. When to Use an RSS Feed</h2><p>The concept of an RSS feed is pretty simple. It is what bridges the gap between your content and internet users. It means it’s not only helpful to podcasters but also to websites, blogs, etc.</p><p>As we all know, the average internet user won’t always have the time to visit your website or podcast channel to check new posts. <strong>So, by using RSS Feed on your website, podcast channel, email, etc., it’ll be easy for them to stay updated with every new content you publish.</strong></p><p>RSS feed is necessary for any podcaster looking to thrive in the industry, and it’s the only way to allow your target audience to access your content quickly.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Do-I-Find-the-RSS-Feed-for-My-Podcast"><a href="#Part-3-How-Do-I-Find-the-RSS-Feed-for-My-Podcast" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How Do I Find the RSS Feed for My Podcast?"></a>Part 3. How Do I Find the RSS Feed for My Podcast?</h2><p>If you’ve uploaded podcasts to a hosting site and you’re wondering where to find the podcast RSS feed links, it’s pretty simple. You don’t need to do anything, as your RSS Feed will be automatically created once you set up your account on the platform.</p><p>Usually, the RSS feed can be found in Settings or the Directories tab. But, of course, that varies according to different hosting sites. So, we take buzzsprout as an example to show you how to get the RSS feed.</p><p>Step1 Open your podcast hosting website and navigate the Directories section. Then, locate any section tagged as Feed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-2.jpg"                      alt="find rss feed from the directories tab"                ></p><p>Step2 Click on the Feed button. You should see the podcast RSS feed. You can easily copy it from there.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-To-Create-an-RSS-Feed-for-a-Podcast"><a href="#Part-4-How-To-Create-an-RSS-Feed-for-a-Podcast" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. How To Create an RSS Feed for a Podcast?"></a>Part 4. How To Create an RSS Feed for a Podcast?</h2><p>However, there is also a case that if you use a self-hosted website for podcasting, you’ll require a plugin to generate your podcast RSS feeds. You can’t use it as it’ll include other blog content instead of the podcast, although your website might have its own RSS feed,</p><p>Then it’s high time to create a podcast RSS feed. Nevertheless, the process depends on whether you’re using a hosting service or not. Read on to find out how to create an RSS feed with or without a hosting platform;</p><h3 id="Method-1-Create-an-RSS-feed-with-hosting-platforms"><a href="#Method-1-Create-an-RSS-feed-with-hosting-platforms" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Create an RSS feed with hosting platforms"></a>Method 1: Create an RSS feed with hosting platforms</h3><p>As mentioned, once you create an account with a podcast hosting website, your podcast RSS Feed will be automatically created. So you just need to complete your account setup, and once you publish a new podcast episode, you can find the RSS Feed in the relevant section of the podcast hosting platform.</p><p>We used the Castos hosting website to generate a podcast RSS Feed in the steps below;</p><p>Step1 Visit Castos website and set up an account with them.</p><p>Step2 Create a new podcast episode and fill in all necessary details in the relevant boxes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-3.jpg"                      alt="create a new podcast episode"                ></p><p>Step3 Navigate to the Podcast Setting area and provide your podcast information, such as Title, Description, Cover art, etc. Afterward, click the relevant button to proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-4.jpg"                      alt="navigate to the podcast setting area"                ></p><p>Step4 Once you successfully save your podcast details and upload the new episode, navigate to the Dashboard and locate your Podcast RSS Feed in the Distribution tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-5.jpg"                      alt="rss feed castos"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Create-an-RSS-feed-without-a-hosting-platform"><a href="#Method-2-Create-an-RSS-feed-without-a-hosting-platform" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Create an RSS feed without a hosting platform"></a>Method 2: Create an RSS feed without a hosting platform</h3><p>Since the native RSS Feed of a self-hosted website usually contains blog article content, which is not needed in a podcast RSS Feed, you need a plugin like Powerpress to generate your podcast RSS feed.</p><p>The PowerPress plugin allows you to generate RSS feed containing only your podcast audio once you publish new content on your website. The following steps explain the process of creating an RSS feed without a hosting platform;</p><p>Step1 Open WordPress and log in to the backend of your WordPress website. Then, select Plugins from the left side and click Add New.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-6.jpg"                      alt="open wordpress"                ></p><p>Step2 Search Powerpress plugin and click the Install button next to “PowerPress Podcasting Plugin by Bluburry.

Click on it and select Settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-8.jpg"                      alt="select settings"                ></p><p>Step4 Click Feed, and you’ll see your RSS Feed link.

What Is an Podcast RSS Feed?</p><p>RSS, Really Simple Syndication, has been around for quite a long time (since 1999), and it was introduced to allow internet users to stay connected with their favorite websites. In other words, it’s used to subscribe to news websites, emails, blogs, podcasts, etc. It is just a simple link looking like this:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-1.jpg"                      alt="rss feed"                ></p><p>Your Podcast RSS feed makes the information about your podcast quickly accessible on various podcast directories, like Apple Podcast and Spotify. Yes, it holds the information about your podcast show and its episodes. So, whenever you create a new episode on the hosting website, it automatically updates it to podcast directories in real-time, thus making it accessible to listeners at their convenience.</p><p>Ultimately, an RSS feed saves you the stress of manually uploading new episodes of your podcast to various platforms! An RSS feed could also be referred to as;</p><ul><li>RSS channel</li><li>Newsfeed</li><li>RSS stream</li><li>Web feed</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-When-to-Use-an-RSS-Feed-1"><a href="#Part-2-When-to-Use-an-RSS-Feed-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. When to Use an RSS Feed"></a>Part 2. When to Use an RSS Feed</h2><p>The concept of an RSS feed is pretty simple. It is what bridges the gap between your content and internet users. It means it’s not only helpful to podcasters but also to websites, blogs, etc.</p><p>As we all know, the average internet user won’t always have the time to visit your website or podcast channel to check new posts. <strong>So, by using RSS Feed on your website, podcast channel, email, etc., it’ll be easy for them to stay updated with every new content you publish.</strong></p><p>RSS feed is necessary for any podcaster looking to thrive in the industry, and it’s the only way to allow your target audience to access your content quickly.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Do-I-Find-the-RSS-Feed-for-My-Podcast-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-Do-I-Find-the-RSS-Feed-for-My-Podcast-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How Do I Find the RSS Feed for My Podcast?"></a>Part 3. How Do I Find the RSS Feed for My Podcast?</h2><p>If you’ve uploaded podcasts to a hosting site and you’re wondering where to find the podcast RSS feed links, it’s pretty simple. You don’t need to do anything, as your RSS Feed will be automatically created once you set up your account on the platform.</p><p>Usually, the RSS feed can be found in Settings or the Directories tab. But, of course, that varies according to different hosting sites. So, we take buzzsprout as an example to show you how to get the RSS feed.</p><p>Step1 Open your podcast hosting website and navigate the Directories section. Then, locate any section tagged as Feed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-2.jpg"                      alt="find rss feed from the directories tab"                ></p><p>Step2 Click on the Feed button. You should see the podcast RSS feed. You can easily copy it from there.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-To-Create-an-RSS-Feed-for-a-Podcast-1"><a href="#Part-4-How-To-Create-an-RSS-Feed-for-a-Podcast-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. How To Create an RSS Feed for a Podcast?"></a>Part 4. How To Create an RSS Feed for a Podcast?</h2><p>However, there is also a case that if you use a self-hosted website for podcasting, you’ll require a plugin to generate your podcast RSS feeds. You can’t use it as it’ll include other blog content instead of the podcast, although your website might have its own RSS feed,</p><p>Then it’s high time to create a podcast RSS feed. Nevertheless, the process depends on whether you’re using a hosting service or not. Read on to find out how to create an RSS feed with or without a hosting platform;</p><h3 id="Method-1-Create-an-RSS-feed-with-hosting-platforms-1"><a href="#Method-1-Create-an-RSS-feed-with-hosting-platforms-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Create an RSS feed with hosting platforms"></a>Method 1: Create an RSS feed with hosting platforms</h3><p>As mentioned, once you create an account with a podcast hosting website, your podcast RSS Feed will be automatically created. So you just need to complete your account setup, and once you publish a new podcast episode, you can find the RSS Feed in the relevant section of the podcast hosting platform.</p><p>We used the Castos hosting website to generate a podcast RSS Feed in the steps below;</p><p>Step1 Visit Castos website and set up an account with them.</p><p>Step2 Create a new podcast episode and fill in all necessary details in the relevant boxes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-3.jpg"                      alt="create a new podcast episode"                ></p><p>Step3 Navigate to the Podcast Setting area and provide your podcast information, such as Title, Description, Cover art, etc. Afterward, click the relevant button to proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-4.jpg"                      alt="navigate to the podcast setting area"                ></p><p>Step4 Once you successfully save your podcast details and upload the new episode, navigate to the Dashboard and locate your Podcast RSS Feed in the Distribution tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-5.jpg"                      alt="rss feed castos"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Create-an-RSS-feed-without-a-hosting-platform-1"><a href="#Method-2-Create-an-RSS-feed-without-a-hosting-platform-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Create an RSS feed without a hosting platform"></a>Method 2: Create an RSS feed without a hosting platform</h3><p>Since the native RSS Feed of a self-hosted website usually contains blog article content, which is not needed in a podcast RSS Feed, you need a plugin like Powerpress to generate your podcast RSS feed.</p><p>The PowerPress plugin allows you to generate RSS feed containing only your podcast audio once you publish new content on your website. The following steps explain the process of creating an RSS feed without a hosting platform;</p><p>Step1 Open WordPress and log in to the backend of your WordPress website.

The company has been producing high-quality aerial photography drones over the last few years and the first blade 350QX was released just two years ago. Since that time Horizon Hobby has produced several new versions of the Blade and the Chroma is the first one to enable the use of a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4K camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Although the 4k version is not the standard version of the Chroma, it is one of the newest and best available in their line.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blade-chroma-quadcopter-drone.jpg"                      alt="blade chroma 4k"                ></p><p> The staple of this configuration is a performance drawn that also includes a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >3-axis gimbal <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and mount that is designed to use a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >GoPro camera <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The Chroma 4k quad copter comes with a CGO3 4k camera or a CGO2+ camera capable of shooting in 1080p. The device can also come with a gimbal made for a GoPro which can be bought separately. The idea of including the attachment for a GoPro is to have a performance drawn that’s capable of competing with the GoPro Karma line by using the same quality camera.</p><h2 id="Pros-and-cons-of-Blade-Chroma"><a href="#Pros-and-cons-of-Blade-Chroma" class="headerlink" title="Pros and cons of Blade Chroma"></a>Pros and cons of Blade Chroma</h2><p> <strong>Pros:</strong></p><ol><li>One of the best parts of using this style of drone is that it comes with a wealth of repair parts and a fantastic range for both the battery as well as for control. Horizon Hobby has always been known for producing performance drones as well as offering some of the best customer service in the market. You will always be able to find parts for this drone as well as instructions on how to repair it and this can really improve the longevity of the device.</li><li>The camera that comes with this drone is also fairly competitive. Although it may not be able to compete with the latest go pro models, it can deliver close to the same image quality with a fair resiliency in several different types of weather.</li><li>The device has some of the best battery life out of any quad copter on the market currently with a flight time rated at up to 30 min.<br> <strong>Cons:</strong></li><li>One of the drawbacks to using this device firstly is that this may not be a drone that you can afford a second battery for. Because the developers used such a large battery to improve flight time, a secondary battery will cost you several hundred dollars.</li><li>Flight times also begin to drop off considerably especially when recording in 4K. Although the replacement parts are easy to source they also grow quite expensive due to the high quality performance of this drone.</li><li>Unlike some other drones in the same price point this one also doesn’t feature anything like GPS Waypoint or some of the collision detection and control features that can be found on similar drones in the price point.<br><strong>Verdict</strong></li></ol><p> Overall this device is fairly easy to use and the camera can be fairly good when compared to other 4K experiences in the same price point. If you are a beginner with drones or you are looking for a device that can fly with autonomous GPS precision, this may not be the right drone for you to pick however. Pilots that want full control at all times are going to enjoy the performance of this drone however.</p><h2 id="Complete-Review-for-Blade-Chroma-Drone"><a href="#Complete-Review-for-Blade-Chroma-Drone" class="headerlink" title="Complete Review for Blade Chroma Drone"></a>Complete Review for Blade Chroma Drone</h2><p> With a drone that’s designed to be extremely versatile and balanced, the Chroma line of drones is designed for his resiliency and it really resembles the look of a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Yuneec Typhoon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> style quad copter. The battery is extremely light weight but also quite powerful and this can improve the speed and performance of the drone while maximizing its weight balanced. The stabilization on this drone for image quality is quite easy to predict and this can be helpful on a drone especially when there is very little in the way of GPS waypoint.</p><h4 id="1-Battery"><a href="#1-Battery" class="headerlink" title="1.  Battery"></a>1.  Battery</h4><p> The battery life on this drone is fairly decent. The 6300mAH battery is one of the largest available on a quad copter today. It takes just under two hours to charge but the replacement batteries are additional batteries can get quite expensive at $120 each minimum. The three cell battery does often keep this drone in flight for 25+ minutes at a time but with the prices for replacement or additional batteries, you may find yourself charging it often.</p><h4 id="2-Flight-Performance"><a href="#2-Flight-Performance" class="headerlink" title="2.  Flight Performance"></a>2.  Flight Performance</h4><p> There are several different flight modes including Smart Mode, Aerial Photography Mode, Follow Me&#x2F;Tracking Mode as well as Return to Home Mode:</p><p> Smart mode is made for beginners while the AP mode is best for the more experienced pilots. The Follow Me mode allows you to focus on lining up the perfect shot as the drone follows you from a distance you preset. Tracking Mode makes the quadcopter follow and keeps the camera focused on whoever is carrying the controller, and the Return Home feature ensures safe landings with just one flip of a switch.</p><h4 id="3-Controller"><a href="#3-Controller" class="headerlink" title="3.  Controller"></a>3.  Controller</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blade-chroma-4k-controller.jpg"                      alt="blade chroma 4k controller"                ></p><p> ST10+ controller has a built-in 5.5-inch touchscreen display to deliver a live view from the camera, making it easy to see how much battery life has been used, how fast the drone is flying as well as other flight information. There’s a little bit of lag between the camera and screen, and the screen lacks the brightness control which makes it hard to observe the info when you are outside on a sunny day.</p><h4 id="4-Camera"><a href="#4-Camera" class="headerlink" title="4.  Camera"></a>4.  Camera</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/blade-chroma-4k-camera.jpg"                      alt="blade chroma 4k camera"                ></p><p> The camera can produce some fairly decent images the UHD quality is great with 4K at 30 frames per second. If you want to get the most out of zoomed shots however, the images on this drone can start to show a bit of rough edges. It’s not great in darker conditions or with shadows especially when compared to the GoPro as well.</p><p> Overall this drone is a lot of fun to fly and it can shoot excellent quality video with the chance to change out the camera for a GoPro if possible. The device is also known for its agility as well as its stability. Although you can’t set GPS flight pattern areas, there are economist modes as well as safeguards which can prevent the drone from crashing into obstacles. This drone is something that’s usually recommended for more experienced pilots but for its base price it can be a lot of fun to use with quality performance and flight time. Professionals will definitely want to upgrade to the 4k camera or use a different camera from the base model however.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/basic-concepts-of-plotting-and-characterizing/"><u>Basic Concepts of Plotting and Characterizing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/your-one-stop-shop-for-unbeatable-tamil-ringtone-purchases-and-edits/"><u>Your One-Stop Shop for Unbeatable Tamil Ringtone Purchases & Edits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/unveiling-av1-foundations-and-fundamentals/"><u>Unveiling AV1  Foundations and Fundamentals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/android-hd-viewing-your-10-app-must-have-guide-for-2024/"><u>Android Hd Viewing  Your 10-App Must-Have Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-bringing-facial-movement-to-life-with-picsarts-effects/"><u>2024 Approved  Bringing Facial Movement to Life with Picsart's Effects</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/supreme-seminar-strategist-summit/"><u>Supreme Seminar Strategist Summit</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/2024s-superior-camera-gear-roundup/"><u>2024'S Superior Camera Gear Roundup</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/updated-ace-your-signature-rapid-background-cleansing-guide/"><u>[Updated] Ace Your Signature  Rapid Background Cleansing Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/updated-step-by-step-guide-to-elevating-your-reddit-game/"><u>[Updated] Step-by-Step Guide to Elevating Your Reddit Game</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-tech-savvy-tips-for-recording-video-calls/"><u>[New] Tech-Savvy Tips for Recording Video Calls</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/how-can-i-create-my-pokemon-overworld-maps-on-apple-iphone-15-pro-max-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>How Can I Create My Pokemon Overworld Maps On Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-recover-old-videos-from-your-motorola-edgeplus-2023-by-fonelab-android-recover-video/"><u>How to recover old videos from your Motorola Edge+ (2023)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-beginners-guide-to-webcam-use-and-recording-on-macbook/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Beginner's Guide to Webcam Use and Recording on MacBook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-everything-you-need-to-know-about-unlocked-apple-iphone-13-mini-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Everything You Need To Know About Unlocked Apple iPhone 13 mini</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/2024-approved-get-a-handful-of-personalized-endings-at-zip/"><u>2024 Approved  Get a Handful of Personalized Endings, at Zip</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-creation-software.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-mastering-xml-files-in-final-cut-pro-x-the-ultimate-guide/"><u>New 2024 Approved Mastering XML Files in Final Cut Pro X The Ultimate Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-spark-conversation-crafting-questions-for-ig-story-boost/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Spark Conversation  Crafting Questions for IG Story Boost</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Letv&#x2F;LeEco Super Helmet 3D VR Head-Mounted Glasses</strong></p><p> It is considered as one of the leading product coming out of the Chinese market. This company has recently released one of their astonishing product called as Super Helmet. This product is capable of holding a 5.5-inch device on its sharp liquid crystal plane. It gives a resolution of about 2560x1440 and also a horizontal view of 70 degrees. This device also offers the user to adjust the lens, which is very helpful for the people who are shortsighted.</p><p><strong>2. DeePoon M2</strong></p><p> DeePoon M2 provides so much in one device, that’s why it is referred to as all in one device. This is not only a headphone or the PC-tethered headset, other than that it also provides services of a powerful headset and everything that a customer needs for its basic virtual reality experience. It provides most of the features but still you don’t get some of the features like motion tracking you get on PC-based system. DeePoon is a Chinese VR producer company that bids a full collection of VR products, extending from VR googles that connect to phones to all-in-one VR phones with in-built motherboards as well as displays.</p><p><strong>3. Antvr Kit</strong></p><p> It is actually a Lenovo made VR headset, and it is one of the earlier products in the field of virtual reality. It is also one of the most recommended products present in the company. The founder of this company ANTVR is actually a fan of science fiction and his interest in this field made him invent this product. As well as, the first prototype of this product was made by the founder himself. In the year 2014, ANTVR effectively finished advertisement for the very first universal virtual reality gear, the ANTVR Kit 1, which is also called Kickstarter.</p><p><strong>4. Ling VR</strong></p><p> It’s a fine constructed and durable viewing design with fair about all being adaptable as well as the headbands it must be appropriate for most of the smartphones and also people乫s heads and sight. While the main material of the gadget is plastic but the face stole is a lenient foam making for a more contented watching experience. Well, this is also not an HMD that will shock anybody away, but it will help to a lot of people to get satisfied with what they brought.</p><p><strong>5. Baofeng Mojing VR 3 and 4</strong></p><p> The two headsets appear to be a bit dissimilar right off because of the presence of head strap in the later version. The preceding kind had the typical three-point method, holding the headset by using the sides and also with a 3rd strap up and over the upper of your head. The innovative version has only a single circular container that cracks in at the top of the headset and then has a modifiable plastic doodad on the posterior part. It’s showier, but it is much tougher to adjust it to remain steady on the skull.</p><p><strong>6. 3Glasses</strong></p><p> The lenses in the 3Glasses provide 110-degree of the Field of Vision (FOV), which is very typical these days in this technology. A couple of sliders on the lowest of the headset confirm that you are able to regulate the lenses to tie your wants, as an alternative to using an immovable system. The comprised 2K resolution display of this headset means you get coarsely 1080p per eye, which is not fairly as solid as the selling varieties of the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift.</p><h2 id="Brief-history-of-Chinese-Virtual-Reality-Headset"><a href="#Brief-history-of-Chinese-Virtual-Reality-Headset" class="headerlink" title="Brief history of Chinese Virtual Reality Headset"></a>Brief history of Chinese Virtual Reality Headset</h2><p> If we talk about these new headsets, we see that almost of these kinds are same in shape and design. In adding to being more nice-looking, the modern Chinese headsets are comfortable, wide field of views, light-weight, have adjustable lenses, and in contrast to the Gear VR, the Chinese designs work with any of the latest smartphones instead of being restricted to just a single brand. The succeeding phase of development for Chinese headsets is going to be complicated and includes transforming headsets from modest dumb cases with lenses to audiences with further built-in technological advancement such as additional sensors, volume controls and back buttons, trackpads, as well as simulated interface situations and conventional application stores. Some Chinese producers have by now started working on virtual reality surroundings that permit operators to steer between dissimilar apps without taking the smartphone out of the headset, but they are presently frequently or totally in Chinese.</p><h2 id="Comparison-Between-Mainstream-VR-Headset-and-Chinese-Headset"><a href="#Comparison-Between-Mainstream-VR-Headset-and-Chinese-Headset" class="headerlink" title="Comparison Between Mainstream VR Headset and Chinese Headset"></a>Comparison Between Mainstream VR Headset and Chinese Headset</h2><p> Virtual Reality has revolutionized the technological world, people are going crazy about this technology and trying it at any cost. In the earlier days of the launch of VR headset, there were only a few brands with a very high cost of products. But with the passage of time, many other companies have made such products at very low costs. Today China has revolutionized the virtual reality even more by producing some of the best products on very low prices so that most people don’t go for the overly priced brands because they are getting approximately the same technology at considerably low prices.</p><p> Let’s mention here some of the best from both brands. Bobo VR Z3 only for $18 and on the other hand Samsun Gear VR for $99. A huge difference in their prices but a very low difference in their quality. And also VR Shinecon for just $23 and LG 360 VR for $199, and the same thing also about them, a huge difference of price but a little difference in quality. So, Chinese market does getting in this race and it is good to say that they are winning too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/decoding-the-process-behind-gopro-burst-recordings/"><u>Decoding the Process Behind GoPro Burst Recordings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/top-8-mobile-tools-transforming-slow-mo-to-fast-forward/"><u>Top 8 Mobile Tools Transforming Slow Mo to Fast-Forward</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-15-fun-filled-multiplayer-titles-for-friends/"><u>2024 Approved  15 Fun-Filled Multiplayer Titles for Friends</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/comprehensive-guide-to-masterful-win11-zoom-use/"><u>Comprehensive Guide to Masterful Win11 Zoom Use</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/in-2024-charting-a-course-through-creative-professions/"><u>In 2024, Charting a Course Through Creative Professions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/essential-green-screen-strategies-in-video-editing-with-kinemaster/"><u>Essential Green Screen Strategies in Video Editing with Kinemaster</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/updated-30plus-best-no-spend-templates-for-after-effects-wizards/"><u>[Updated] 30+ Best No-Spend Templates for After Effects Wizards</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/powerful-type-tools-to-transform-visual-narratives/"><u>Powerful Type Tools to Transform Visual Narratives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/updated-iphoneandroid-edition-find-the-best-8-multimedia-editing-tools/"><u>[Updated] IPhone/Android Edition  Find the Best 8 Multimedia Editing Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/from-joke-to-share-perfecting-the-meme-process/"><u>From Joke to Share  Perfecting the Meme Process</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-unleash-the-potential-of-your-webcam-for-slideshows-for-2024/"><u>[New] Unleash the Potential of Your Webcam for Slideshows for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-manually-install-a-hardware-driver-in-windows-11107-by-drivereasy-guide/"><u>How to Manually Install a Hardware Driver in Windows 11/10/7</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-tips.techidaily.com/updated-top-10-user-friendly-budget-optimizing-passport-photo-creators/"><u>[Updated] Top 10 User-Friendly, Budget-Optimizing Passport Photo Creators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-navigating-facebook-analytics-simplified/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Navigating Facebook Analytics Simplified</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-snicker-surgeons-top-7-sketches-for-youtube-laughter-aficionados/"><u>[Updated] Snicker Surgeons  Top 7 Sketches for YouTube Laughter Aficionados</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/new-clear-distraction-free-viewing-of-old-youtube-content/"><u>[New] Clear, Distraction-Free Viewing of Old YouTube Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-fake-android-location-without-rooting-for-your-xiaomi-redmi-note-12t-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/"><u>In 2024, Fake Android Location without Rooting For Your Xiaomi Redmi Note 12T Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

So, suppose the podcast file you try to upload is greyed out. Then, chances are GarageBand does not support its codec.</p><p><strong>Here are the fixes we recommend for this error</strong></p><p>To fix this error, you have to change the file from .mp3 to .wav. If you’re using your iPhone, you can use a file converter app to operate. But if you’re on a macOS, you need to locate the podcast MP3 file, right-click on it, then rename it to be in .wav format.</p><p>This <a class="link"   href="https://youtu.be/CeuA1shy1u4" >YouTube video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> should walk you through the process better.</p><h3 id="Error-3-The-save-file-operation-failed"><a href="#Error-3-The-save-file-operation-failed" class="headerlink" title="Error 3: The save file operation failed"></a>Error 3: The save file operation failed</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/edit-podcasts-in-garageband-11.jpg"                      alt="the save file operation failed"                ></p><p>Another error is the inability to save the file.

Viewers can add comments on videos and they can also forward “hearts” to streamers as a token of appreciation for their impressive work. The app is actually very interaction with four major tabs:</p><p> 1. You will find two lists on <strong>first tab:</strong></p><p> First one is the Teleport option that takes broadcaster to any random place in world and reflects that place as your active broadcast location.</p><p> The second list contains information about all those broadcasts that you have viewed within last 24 hours.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-periscope-1.jpg"                      alt="use-periscope-1 "                ></p><p> 2. <strong>The second tab</strong> on application is used to display list of public broadcasts on global level and users are free to join all of them. They are developed on the basis of your geographical location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-periscope-2.jpg"                      alt="use-periscope-2 "                ></p><p> 3. <strong>The third tab</strong> again contains the information about list of live public broadcasts in list format.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-periscope-3.jpg"                      alt="use-periscope-3 "                ></p><p> 4. <strong>The fourth tab</strong> is designed to assist users with easy search for followers. It also displays settings for your own profile and allows users to make basic adjustments for followers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-periscope-4.jpg"                      alt="use-periscope-4 "                ></p><h2 id="How-to-watch-Periscope-Video"><a href="#How-to-watch-Periscope-Video" class="headerlink" title="How to watch Periscope Video?"></a>How to watch Periscope Video?</h2><p> If you want to enjoy a live broadcast on Periscope then you can either try the list format or go for the map version on global broadcast tab; simply touch over the ongoing event that seems interesting to you. It also allows real time interactions with the broadcasters as well as other users that are connected during a particular live event.</p><p><strong>The lists of features include:</strong></p><p> 1. You will find a say something field on your application at bottom portion; whenever you want to comment for any event, you can put your text in this field.</p><p> 2. On the right side, you will observe hearts and they keep on floating upward. Whenever you find something very interesting or just want to appreciate the efforts of broadcaster on channel then you can use these hearts as token for your words of appreciation. You need to tap on the screen to send this heart to broadcaster.</p><p> 3. There is a little person on bottom right corner of your app screen; it provides information about number of viewers on your broadcast. If you touch this tiny icon, it will take you to another page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-periscope-5.jpg"                      alt="use-periscope-5 "                ></p><h2 id="How-to-Broadcast-on-Periscope"><a href="#How-to-Broadcast-on-Periscope" class="headerlink" title="How to Broadcast on Periscope?"></a>How to Broadcast on Periscope?</h2><p> As per the default setting, broadcasts stay public that means anyone can watch what you have uploaded. But in case if you want to prioritize your audience then Periscope application offers easy personalization. Use private broadcast feature to invite selected audience on your broadcasts. This broadcast setting icon is actually a small camera like shape that can be used from first as well as second tab easily.</p><p> During your very first visit to broadcast screen, you will find a permission required pop up. Here you have to hit on allow permissions option. Now enable all three options that appear on screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-periscope-6.jpg"                      alt="use-periscope-6 "                ></p><p> Now you are at broadcast screen where you have to enter name or title of your broadcast event. Users can adjust their location preferences while converting broadcasts from private to public or vice versa view. Adjust the chat options and finally you will reach at your Twitter link. If you want to capture feeds from webcam then it can be switched easily by simply double tapping on device screen. Once all these controls have been adjusted then your app provides an event summery, you can approve it or edit before making your post live. It will also provide you details about how many hearts you have received from viewers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-periscope-7.jpg"                      alt="use-periscope-7 "                ></p><p> Once your broadcast becomes live then it will stay online for next 24 hours and all viewers and followers will be able to replay, watch as well as share the information with other users. The collection of hearts as viewer’s response may go on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-periscope-8.jpg"                      alt="use-periscope-8 "                ></p><h2 id="Tips-to-get-more-followers-or-viewers-on-Periscope"><a href="#Tips-to-get-more-followers-or-viewers-on-Periscope" class="headerlink" title="Tips to get more followers or viewers on Periscope"></a>Tips to get more followers or viewers on Periscope</h2><p> There is no doubt to say that Periscope is a wonderful tool if you want to make your career as a live streaming and want to grow size of your followers fast.
