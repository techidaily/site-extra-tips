Ready Player One"></a>1. Ready Player One</h3><p>Ready Player One is a picture set in 2045 by Stephen Spielberg. In this movie about metaverse, everyone living in a world of 2045 spends their time with a virtual reality headset covering their eyes and oblivion to the real world in a bit to navigate the OASIS, a virtual world. The developer launches an Easter egg which he turns into a treasure hunt, promising that whoever finds it takes control of the OASIS. Wade Watts, a character who is an orphan, joins others in search of this Easter egg. Spielberg in this movie refers to pop culture without losing the movie’s futuristic attribute, which makes it a great film. In this movie, the audience or viewer is immersed in reality and virtually. It shows the world’s excesses beyond what we can see at the moment. The characters in the movie realize when they take off their headsets that there isn’t any distinction between the virtual and the true world. This is the essence of the metaverse, a world where you can have your daily activities in a virtual world with elements of reality.</p><h3 id="2-Tron"><a href="#2-Tron" class="headerlink" title="2. Tron"></a>2. Tron</h3><p>Tron is another movie about metaverse created in 1982. In the film Tron, a video game developer finds himself in the world of computers, where he encounters Tron.

This metaverse movie details the virtual world, a world of computers beyond reality.</p><h3 id="3-Minority-Report"><a href="#3-Minority-Report" class="headerlink" title="3. Minority Report"></a>3. Minority Report</h3><p>Minority Report is a movie about the metaverse set in 2054. In the film, the police use psychic technology to arrest criminals for crimes they are yet to commit.

Doctor Who: Silence In The Library &amp; Forest Of The Dead</h3><p>This 2008 movie, set in the 51st century, shows a doctor and his companion arriving in a library that comprises every piece of information about the universe but is empty.

This <strong>reality vs. the metaverse</strong> movie details a world where consciousness can transfer between bodies assessing the relationship between memory and Physicality.

Person of Interest"></a>6. Person of Interest</h3><p>Person of Interest is a metaverse movie set in the US. It shows a millionaire who has a computer that can predict who will be killed and when. Comparing reality VS the metaverse movie, Person of Interest, you realize that it is almost unbelievable as it does not exist yet. But that is the essence of the metaverse, an internet realm that goes beyond the universe.</p><h3 id="7-Avatar"><a href="#7-Avatar" class="headerlink" title="7. Avatar"></a>7. Avatar</h3><p>In this metaverse movie, Avatar places humans in a species capable of things beyond human intelligence. Merely being able to transfer a human’s consciousness to another is stunning.

Strange Days</h3><p>This reality vs. metaverse movie shows an illegal technology in which you can record your sensory feel so that other people can experience them. The film relates to the metaverse as it depicts a world of the internet where something that extreme could exist in the computer world.

This is only science fiction and is not yet in existence at the time.</p><h3 id="10-Wreck-it-Ralph"><a href="#10-Wreck-it-Ralph" class="headerlink" title="10. Wreck-it Ralph"></a>10. Wreck-it Ralph</h3><p>Wreck-it Ralph tries to depict what goes on with video game characters when they are not in play. When the machine is off, the characters assemble in complex cyberspace in artistic representations of zeros and ones. This is a typical reality vs. metaverse movie that explores a world of games beyond reality.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>The world is heading for a more advanced form of technology that would go beyond what we are used to. However, comparing reality vs. the metaverse movies available to us now, we would realize that we could adapt as there isn’t much difference between both worlds. We could still carry on our daily activities in the metaverse space as if nothing had changed. Thus, in preparation for this future advancement that is almost here, we could also do well to see more metaverse movies like the ones listed above. Besides, as per Mark Zuckerberg, we might even be in for some exciting Facebook metaverse movies soon.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>The word ‘meta’ means beyond, whereas ‘verse’ has to do with the universe. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >What is Metaverse? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Metaverse refers to a state of technology that transcends the universe.

Given the way Microsoft has added powerful features to Photos, it has the capability to offer much more to users. One such feature is the option to add the effect of slow motion in Windows 10 using the Photos app. We will explain how you can use the slow motion feature in Photos, along with an option to add the effect of slow motion online.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1"><strong>Part1: How to Use Slow Motion in Windows 10</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part2"><strong>Part2: Customizing the Slow Motion Effect</strong></a></li><li><a href="#part3"><strong>Part3: How to Edit in Slow Motion Online</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1：How-to-Use-Slow-Motion-in-Windows-10"><a href="#Part-1：How-to-Use-Slow-Motion-in-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="Part 1：How to Use Slow Motion in Windows 10"></a>Part 1：How to Use Slow Motion in Windows 10</h2><p>There is no need to spend hundreds of dollars on a video program if you need to perform some basic editing and effects on your videos. For instance, you can add the slow motion effect using the Photos app that comes pre-installed on Windows 10 computers.</p><p>Navigate to the folder where your video file is located and right click on it. You will go to “open with” and then choose the Photos app. When it is open in the application, you can click on “Edit &amp; Create” and then go to “Add slo-mo”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slow-motion-photos-app.jpg"                      alt="slow motion video microsoft photos"                ></p><p>If you do not see the option anywhere on your Photos app, there is a chance you are running an outdated version of Windows 10 on your computer. All you need to do is navigate to Windows Update through your system menu. When all the updates install, you will have the latest Photos app with this feature.</p><h2 id="Part-2：Customizing-the-Slow-Motion-Effect"><a href="#Part-2：Customizing-the-Slow-Motion-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Part 2：Customizing the Slow Motion Effect"></a>Part 2：Customizing the Slow Motion Effect</h2><p>When you are using the Photos app to add a slow motion effect to your videos, you can tweak it to your liking. You will be able to select the speed using a slider, which lets you get the precise slow motion effect that you desire.</p><p>There is also the handy option of being able to select the portion of your video where you want to add this effect. Say you are producing a longer video, where you want the effect in place for a few seconds.</p><p>Now you can select the beginning and end point using the bottom slider on the Photos app. Choose the precise starting and ending of the slow motion effect, and then watch through your video to ensure it is exactly as you want.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-slow-motion-microsoft-photos.jpg"                      alt="slow motion video microsoft photos"                ></p><p>We recommend that you save your video file under a new name when you are done making your desired changes. It ensures that you still have the original copy of the video saved on your computer or external hard drive.</p><p>You can even create multiple versions of the file with the slow motion effect applied in different ways. Then you can watch the videos you just created to decide on the best version.</p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Use Story Remix to Edit a Video in Windows 10 Photos &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2132162/7443" target="_top" id="2132162">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2132162" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2132162/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Edit-in-Slow-Motion-Online"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Edit-in-Slow-Motion-Online" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Edit in Slow Motion Online"></a>Part 3: How to Edit in Slow Motion Online</h2><p>If you are not able to access a Windows computer, you may want a solution that can be used online.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="The-Enhancements-in-VegasPro-with-Its-2019-Release"><a href="#The-Enhancements-in-VegasPro-with-Its-2019-Release" class="headerlink" title="The Enhancements in VegasPro with Its 2019 Release"></a>The Enhancements in VegasPro with Its 2019 Release</h2><p>A fresh take on the traditional video editing program is VEGAS Pro 19. New name, new features, but is VEGAS still the same under the surface? VEGAS has always involved some dice-rolling. In our evaluation of VEGAS Movie Studio 17, the video editor received a definite 2.5-star average (the same goes for VEGAS Movie Studio 15).</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/vegas-pro-19.jpg"                      alt="vegas pro 19"                ></p><p>We criticized the software, saying that it was “not as good as the VEGAS name would have you believe.” Although some tools are incorporated in a very brilliant, innovative, and intuitive way, on the whole it feels too restricting away from your most basic demands. Your alternatives are restricted, or excessively concealed, overly complex, or unclear.</p><p>However, we are all still developing. In the same way, VEGAS Pro 19 offers a number of new tools that are suited for both novice and experienced video editors, even though it isn’t considered to be one of the best alternatives to Adobe Premiere Pro.</p><p>Let’s dive in!</p><h2 id="Color-grading"><a href="#Color-grading" class="headerlink" title="Color grading"></a>Color grading</h2><p>Changing the interface’s colors to make the experience better when editing is one thing, but it’s also good to</p><p>see that actual color correction has been improved as well.</p><p>The Grading Panel has been redesigned, like thinner looking range-limited color wheels, which give you more</p><p>control over the adjustments you’re making.</p><p>VEGAS also comes with 40 LUTs, and expanded individual R, G, B curves, among others, making color correction work more precise and enjoyable than before.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105867/7443" target="_top" id="2105867">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105867" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105867/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Track-effects"><a href="#Track-effects" class="headerlink" title="Track effects"></a>Track effects</h2><p>Thankfully, not all of the links go to paid internet services. For your workflow, VEGAS Pro offers a number of great new additions. “Adjustment Tracks” is one of these. You can apply filters to entire tracks rather of needing to add them to individual segments.</p><p>By doing so, you may apply the same effects to numerous clips and manage their settings from a single area. Even better, you can keyframe these effects directly from the timeline to change their intensity over time. It’s simply some incredible visual effects software that wasn’t even imaginable previously in VEGAS.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118322/7443" target="_top" id="2118322">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118322" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118322/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Scene-detection"><a href="#Scene-detection" class="headerlink" title="Scene detection"></a>Scene detection</h2><p>With version 19, VEGAS added a brand-new feature. They believe it to be so crucial that they have offered three options for doing it: split it whenever a cut occurs, examine finished, exported projects that you’ve brought back to the editing suite. Since we’ve been editing short films for almost 20 years, we haven’t needed to do it very often, but since we’re hoarders, most of our work are still accessible and editable. We become aware of how outnumbered we are as a result of this new characteristic.</p><h2 id="Upscale-options"><a href="#Upscale-options" class="headerlink" title="Upscale options"></a>Upscale options</h2><p>Upscaling is a fascinating advancement as well. The prior filter was getting on in years, but VEGAS has since unveiled a new AI-based one that performs far better. It claims to be able to transcode SD film (720x480) all the way up to 4K. (3840 x 2160). The filter has a straightforward slider; the higher you move it, the closer and more in-depth the clip will be with AI.</p><p>Naturally, the effects will be better the crisper and cleaner the source clip is. To be sure, the gadget is a surprising advancement, but one that is welcome. particularly when compared to earlier iterations of the video editing program.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148634/16836" target="_top" id="2148634">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148634" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="80" height="31"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148634/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="VEGAS-Hub"><a href="#VEGAS-Hub" class="headerlink" title="VEGAS Hub"></a>VEGAS Hub</h2><p>The addition of the VEGAS Hub is one of the most noticeable visual changes. In both the form of a large login button at the top of the interface and a tab directly over the timeline.</p><p>VEGAS’ online presence is expanding, but the majority of the fun new features will only be available to subscribers. These days, it seems impossible to escape subscriptions; popular editors like Adobe Premiere Pro and Cyberlink PowerDirector both contain them. However, similar to PowerDirector, you have the option of subscribing or buying the software altogether.</p><p>One of these benefits is the capability to sync media between devices and save it online. It implies that moviemakers can use their smartphones to capture video, edit it, and then post it to the Hub. By the time you return to your editing station, those clips will be prepared.</p><p>Text to Speech, another intriguing subscription-only feature, speaks any sentences you provide it with using computer-generated voices.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144297/7443" target="_top" id="2144297">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144297" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144297/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Price-points"><a href="#Price-points" class="headerlink" title="Price points"></a>Price points</h2><p>With the new “Automatic Scene Detection,” you no longer need to manually clip your file if you need to re-edit or use a project but no longer have access to the original material, only the finished product. Selecting the file from the Project Media folder and selecting “Detect Scenes and Add to Timeline” are two options for doing this. VEGAS examines it, makes edits, and inserts each segment in turn to the timeline where the playhead is situated.</p><p>The same thing may be accomplished by choosing the alternative option of “Detect Scenes and Create Subclips,” except that it won’t add anything to the timeline and will instead add subclips of each cut to your Project Media folder. The last item is “Scene Detection” under Video FX. You have certain customization choices with this filter that are not available with the other two approaches. You have access to three sliders that allow you to alter the cuts’ sensitivity.</p><p>Who else is transitioning to a subscription model? VEGAS is. But those who favor paying for a perpetual license haven’t yet been forgotten. VEGAS Edit costs $250, Pro costs $400, and Post costs $600. In actuality, this is less expensive than the prior iteration. The cost of a subscription is either $13, $20, or $30 each month.</p><p>The subscription model does offer benefits in addition to those already highlighted. For instance, Edit offers 20 royalty-free HD films and stock music samples for download each month along with 20GB of cloud storage.</p><p>With Pro, you have unlimited access to their material catalog, 50GB of additional online storage, VEGAS Stream streaming software, the top-notch Primatte chroma-keying program, and Sound Forge audio editing tools.</p><p>You get 100GB of cloud storage with Post, along with the photo editor VEGAS Image and the high-end visual effects compositing software VEGAS Effects.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-unlocking-the-door-to-dual-video-playback-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Unlocking the Door to Dual Video Playback for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/best-free-and-paid-blu-ray-video-player-software-for-pcandmac/"><u>Best Free and Paid Blu-Ray Video Player Software for PC&Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/from-fixed-frame-to-fluid-motion-live-photo-transformation/"><u>From Fixed Frame to Fluid Motion Live Photo Transformation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/google-play-services-wont-update-12-fixes-are-here-on-tecno-pova-5-pro-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Google Play Services Wont Update? 12 Fixes are Here on Tecno Pova 5 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/hacks-to-do-pokemon-go-trainer-battles-for-oppo-a56s-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Hacks to do pokemon go trainer battles For Oppo A56s 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-ultimate-list-10-best-free-and-paid-android-video-editing-apps-2023/"><u>New In 2024, The Ultimate List 10 Best Free and Paid Android Video Editing Apps 2023</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/platform-exclusive-games-might-be-a-thing-of-the-past-heres-why-thats-good/"><u>Platform-Exclusive Games Might Be a Thing of The Past: Here's Why That's Good</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/stealthy-styles-easy-color-corrections-techniques/"><u>Stealthy Styles Easy Color Corrections Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/zooming-in-elevating-the-art-of-tiktok-crafting/"><u>Zooming In Elevating the Art of TikTok Crafting</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Plus, subtitles also work as an informative tool, adding legible text at the side of videos explaining particular concepts or additional information not covered in the video.</p><p>While creating or editing videos, using an <strong>online subtitle converter</strong> will help you insert such elements in the project directly from the text, audio clips, or the video itself.

However, with so many options, it can get confusing to select one full version. At this point, you should consider the following points carefully to make your software choice.</p><p><strong>(1) Simple to use</strong></p><p>The first point to consider is how simple the software is for professional editors and total newcomers. You can access the video editing interface on some sites by clicking the “Edit” button on the imported video. Once the website has opened, click the “Subtitle” tab at the top and then hit the plus (+) button. Upload the SRT file that you just saved.</p><p>Most <strong>Sub to SRT converter online</strong> requires manual work for the conversions. Some, like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, allow automated subtitle transcription, which is easier to deal with.</p><p><strong>(2) Using experience</strong></p><p>The level of features and the variety can highly improve user experience. For example, in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, thousands of Titles and Text presets may be used for Openers, Titles, Lower Thirds, Subtitles, and Closing Credits. Plus, with the Text Editor panel, you can apply templates and add motion, text color fill, and text background. All of these features guarantee a satisfying user experience.</p><p><strong>(3) Format supported</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Video formats:</strong> AVI, MP4, MKV, WMV, MPG, MPEG, VOB, TOD, MOD, FLV, and all regular video formats.</li><li><strong>Subtitle formats:</strong> SRT, ASS, SSA</li></ul><p>While subtitles are helpful for deaf and hard-of-hearing people, there are other reasons to include captions. For example, when watching videos in public but not with earbuds, subtitles still allow them to understand what’s happening. These videos, whether for smaller clips or movies, are different in size, format, language, OS compatibility, etc.</p><p>So, when you are using a <strong>TXT to SRT converter online</strong>, see if it allows you to make multiple changes easily and if it supports varying formats without lagging or bugs.</p><h2 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>For audiences to comprehend your content better, videos must include subtitles. For that, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, EditingTools.io, Rev, and VEED, are some of the best options to trust with various beneficial qualities.

However, with so many options, it can get confusing to select one full version. At this point, you should consider the following points carefully to make your software choice.</p><p><strong>(1) Simple to use</strong></p><p>The first point to consider is how simple the software is for professional editors and total newcomers. You can access the video editing interface on some sites by clicking the “Edit” button on the imported video. Once the website has opened, click the “Subtitle” tab at the top and then hit the plus (+) button. Upload the SRT file that you just saved.</p><p>Most <strong>Sub to SRT converter online</strong> requires manual work for the conversions. Some, like <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, allow automated subtitle transcription, which is easier to deal with.</p><p><strong>(2) Using experience</strong></p><p>The level of features and the variety can highly improve user experience. For example, in <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, thousands of Titles and Text presets may be used for Openers, Titles, Lower Thirds, Subtitles, and Closing Credits. Plus, with the Text Editor panel, you can apply templates and add motion, text color fill, and text background. All of these features guarantee a satisfying user experience.</p><p><strong>(3) Format supported</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Video formats:</strong> AVI, MP4, MKV, WMV, MPG, MPEG, VOB, TOD, MOD, FLV, and all regular video formats.</li><li><strong>Subtitle formats:</strong> SRT, ASS, SSA</li></ul><p>While subtitles are helpful for deaf and hard-of-hearing people, there are other reasons to include captions. For example, when watching videos in public but not with earbuds, subtitles still allow them to understand what’s happening. These videos, whether for smaller clips or movies, are different in size, format, language, OS compatibility, etc.</p><p>So, when you are using a <strong>TXT to SRT converter online</strong>, see if it allows you to make multiple changes easily and if it supports varying formats without lagging or bugs.</p><h2 id="Final-Words-1"><a href="#Final-Words-1" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>For audiences to comprehend your content better, videos must include subtitles. For that, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, EditingTools.io, Rev, and VEED, are some of the best options to trust with various beneficial qualities. Of course, everyone has different preferences and needs for a subtitle converter. Go through these and choose one that suits your requirements best.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-info.techidaily.com/new-elevating-your-text-with-advanced-3d-effects-for-2024/"><u>[New] Elevating Your Text with Advanced 3D Effects for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-innovators-crafting-immersive-viewscape/"><u>[New] Innovators Crafting Immersive Viewscape</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-the-complete-walkthrough-for-android-audio-personalization/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, The Complete Walkthrough for Android Audio Personalization</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-17-best-digital-erasers-for-image-layer-cleaning/"><u>2024 Approved 17 Best Digital Erasers for Image Layer Cleaning</u></a></li><li><a href="https://solve-outstanding.techidaily.com/firefox/"><u>日本語版ビデオダウンロードヘルパーを使い始める - Firefox用アドオンの保存方法</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/complete-motion-survey-2023-for-2024/"><u>Complete Motion Survey 2023 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techtrends.techidaily.com/comprehensive-guide-to-fixing-high-resource-usage-by-service-host-on-win10-pcs/"><u>Comprehensive Guide to Fixing High Resource Usage by Service Host on Win10 PCs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/crafting-the-perfect-tiktok-unbox-video-a-viewership-guide-for-2024/"><u>Crafting the Perfect TikTok Unbox Video A Viewership Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/decoding-varieties-in-hand-motion-tracking/"><u>Decoding Varieties in Hand Motion Tracking</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-step-by-step-guide-on-using-adb-and-fastboot-to-remove-frp-lock-from-your-honor-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, A Step-by-Step Guide on Using ADB and Fastboot to Remove FRP Lock from your Honor</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-tips.techidaily.com/top-ranked-gamer-laptop-picks-for-2n4-your-ultimate-buyers-guide/"><u>Top-Ranked Gamer Laptop Picks for 2N4: Your Ultimate Buyer's Guide</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Twitch and YouTube Compared"></a>Binge-Watch or Live-Stream? Twitch and YouTube Compared</h2><p>In recent years, the popularity of streaming content has exploded. This is due to the launch of platforms like Twitch and Youtube, which have made it easier for content creators&#x2F;streamers to reach a wide audience. But how do these two platforms differ?</p><p>In this article, we’ll take a comprehensive look at <strong>Twitch vs. Youtube</strong> by comparing their browsing, content rule leniency, growth, and monetization. By the end, you’ll have a good understanding of which platform is right for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/twitch-vs-youtube.jpg"                      alt="twitch vs youtube"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Key-Differences-Between-Twitch-and-YouTube"><a href="#Part-1-The-Key-Differences-Between-Twitch-and-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. The Key Differences Between Twitch and YouTube"></a>Part 1. The Key Differences Between Twitch and YouTube</h2><p>Though Twitch and YouTube share some similarities, there are also some key differences between the two:</p><p><strong>Browsing:</strong> Twitch and YouTube are search engines, but they differ in how they recommend videos to viewers. Twitch focuses on more popular streamers and doesn’t let users edit their thumbnails, while YouTube makes it easier for newbies to be found with a customizable thumbnail feature.</p><p><strong>Content Rule Leniency:</strong> Twitch and YouTube’s content guidelines are slightly different. YouTube is more easygoing when it comes to what videos can be posted. On the other hand, Twitch has a reputation for banning streamers without any justification. Even streamers with contracts seem to be treated the same as anyone else when this happens.</p><p><strong>Growth:</strong> YouTube offers more advantages over Twitch in terms of growth as it is more accessible and has a better algorithm that allows small content creators to grow their channels quickly. However, Twitch mainly focuses on popular content streamers and offers fewer growth opportunities for newbies.</p><p><strong>Monetization:</strong> When it comes to monetization, both platforms offer different options for content creators. On Twitch, content creators can earn revenue from subscriptions, sponsored advertisements, donations, affiliate programs, merchandise sales, etc. On YouTube, content creators can earn revenue from direct advertisements, sponsorships, partnership programs, streams, donations, etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/youtube-monetization.jpg"                      alt="youtube monetization"                ></p><p><strong>Chat and Moderation Policies:</strong> Twitch uses a time-based strict chat moderation policy and does not have the pause or rewind option. While on YouTube, the chat is arranged based on relevance and comes with only standard emojis for visual presentation.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Comparison-of-Two-Important-Features-Between-Twitch-and-YOUTUBE-Partnership-and-Gaming"><a href="#Part-2-Comparison-of-Two-Important-Features-Between-Twitch-and-YOUTUBE-Partnership-and-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

These include a consistent uploading or streaming schedule, viewer engagement on your content, certain watch times, and the required number of subscribers on your channel.</p><p>Unlike YouTube, Twitch offers both affiliate and partnership programs.

Over the past few years, two of the biggest platforms for streaming gaming content have been Twitch and YouTube. So which platform is worth using? Let’s find out!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/twitch-gaming.jpg"                      alt="twitch gaming"                ></p><p><strong>Algorithm:</strong> Twitch algorithm is mainly based on the number of viewers on your videos. Moreover, when browsing, it mainly suggests only the popular streamers with a strong subscriber base.</p><p>On the other hand, YouTube is owned by Google and creates more opportunities for streamers to be found. Also, its search algorithm takes into account the number of likes, comments, and shares on your video.</p><p><strong>Streamer-Viewer Dynamics:</strong> On Twitch, viewers often get more involved with the streamer as opposed to YouTube gaming viewers, who prefer to watch videos without commentary.</p><p><strong>Engagement Requirements For Streamers:</strong> To grow on YouTube, you need at least 4000 hours of watch time and a good number of likes, shares, and comments on your video. While on Twitch, you need at least a 20-30% engagement rate and a large number of subscribers.</p><p><strong>Competition Level Of Streamer:</strong> YouTube has fewer streamers but a 20 times more extensive user base. The potential for growth for new streamers is much higher due to the lower competition on the platform. Additionally, the platform provides more prominent exposure for new content creators.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123726/7443" target="_top" id="2123726">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123726" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123726/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Verdict"><a href="#Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Verdict"></a>Verdict</h3><p>Twitch is a better streaming platform if you want to cultivate a following around your content.

The higher the number of followers&#x2F;viewers, the more you will earn. Here’s how each platform pays its streamers.</p><h3 id="How-Twitch-Pay-Their-Streamers"><a href="#How-Twitch-Pay-Their-Streamers" class="headerlink" title="How Twitch Pay Their Streamers"></a>How Twitch Pay Their Streamers</h3><p>There are five ways in which you can make money while streaming your content on Twitch:</p><p><strong>Ads:</strong> You can turn on ads on your content when your stream gets the affiliate’s status. Ad revenues are based on the number of impressions (views) your content receives, and the average payout is $0.25 - $1.50 per 1,000 views.</p><p><strong>Bits</strong>: As a streamer on Twitch, you can also receive donations from your viewers in the form of a unique currency on the platform known as Bits. It’s important to note that Twitch takes a 29% cut-off of all donations made this way, leaving the streamer with 71% of the total donation. We have a complete guide to help you understand <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >what Twitch Bits are and how to earn&#x2F;get them for free. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/twitch-bits.jpg"                      alt="twitch bits"                ></p><p><strong>Donations:</strong> Donations made through Paypal or other monetary exchange platforms benefit the streamer as they will receive 100% of the donation. This is the cheaper way of ensuring that the streamer gets the entire donation amount from the viewer.</p><p><strong>Subscribers:</strong> Subscribers can support your channel by getting a subscription for a minimum of $4.99 per month. Twitch only takes 50% of subscription fees. This makes it much more profitable for streamers, as they can earn $2.50 per subscription per month.</p><p><strong>Merchandise:</strong> In terms of merchandise, Twitch has an advantage over YouTube because it comes with various merchandising extensions that can help you to make sales directly to your viewers during a live stream without the need for them to leave the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/twitch-monetization.jpg"                      alt="twitch monetization"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094419/7443" target="_top" id="2094419">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094419" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094419/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="How-YouTube-Pay-Their-Streamers"><a href="#How-YouTube-Pay-Their-Streamers" class="headerlink" title="How YouTube Pay Their Streamers"></a>How YouTube Pay Their Streamers</h3><p>YouTube pays its streamers in three different ways:</p><p><strong>Ads:</strong> Once your channel reaches a specific threshold, you become eligible for displaying ads on your YouTube channel. YouTube ads pay more than Twitch. For each 1000 ad views, you will get $18, which means you can earn up to $3 to $5 per 1k video views.</p><p><strong>Members:</strong> YouTube members are equivalent to Twitch’s subscribers. YouTube pays 70% of membership fees to the creators. The eligibility to offer channel memberships opens up at 30,000 subscribers for all types of channels, but for gaming channels, in particular, a minimum of 1,000 subscribers are required. Additionally, creators must also be a part of the YouTube Partner Program.</p><p><strong>Super Chat:</strong> Youtube pays streamers 70% of each super chat donation made on the platform and retains 30%. While this may seem to be expensive, it helps cover the costs of hosting a Livestream. Without this donation, Youtube would not be able to function as smoothly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/youtube-super-chat.jpg"                      alt="youtube super chat"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094421/7443" target="_top" id="2094421">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094421" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094421/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Which-Pays-More"><a href="#Which-Pays-More" class="headerlink" title="Which Pays More?"></a>Which Pays More?</h3><p>Due to the lower threshold for monetization, Twitch pays more to the new content creators and offers more monetization options.

But you didn’t have time to go through it, and you bookmarked it. Now, you came back to read it and, oh no…… It has been deleted for some reason.</p><p>No need to worry. You can see deleted Reddit posts in seconds. In fact, there are several simple methods to do this.</p><p>We’ll cover the best ones below and explain how to use each one.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">Unddit</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">Reveddit</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">Resavr</a></li><li><a href="#part1-4">The Wayback Machine</a></li><li><a href="#part1-5">Google Cache</a></li></ol><h2 id="5-Ways-to-See-Deleted-Reddit-Posts"><a href="#5-Ways-to-See-Deleted-Reddit-Posts" class="headerlink" title="5 Ways to See Deleted Reddit Posts"></a>5 Ways to See Deleted Reddit Posts</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/1995803/22899" target="_top" id="1995803">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-1995803" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/1995803/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Unddit"><a href="#1-Unddit" class="headerlink" title="1. Unddit"></a>1. Unddit</h3><p>Unddit is a third-party tool that uses Pushshift.io. This is a database that stores comments users leave on Reddit.</p><p>The main reason Unddit is so popular and used is because of its simplicity. It is easy to use the tool and takes about 10 seconds to set it all up. Let’s go over the steps to use Unddit and reveal some deleted comments on Reddit.</p><p>Step1 First, go to <a class="link"   href="https://www.unddit.com/" >Unddit.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Step2 Click on the red “Unddit” button and drag it to your bookmark bar</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/red-unddit-button.png"                      alt="unddit button pointing to bookmark"                ></p><p>Step3 Go to the deleted Reddit post</p><p>Step4 Click on the Unddit bookmark you just saved</p><p>This will automatically lead you to a new page. There, Unddit analyses and displays all the deleted comments from that post.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/unddit-results.png"                      alt="results page on unddit tool"                ></p><p>On the downside, Reddit doesn’t work well with most Reddit posts. It’s more effective for revealing deleted comments. Additionally, it may show an error from time to time. Unfortunately, the reason isn’t always displayed, and it’s something we need to live with.</p><h3 id="2-Reveddit"><a href="#2-Reveddit" class="headerlink" title="2. Reveddit"></a>2. Reveddit</h3><p>Unlike Unddit, Reveddit will always help you find deleted Reddit posts. It’s a powerful tool and much more stable compared to so many others out there.</p><p>This tool tracks Reddit activity in real-time. For example, you can use it to track deleted posts from specific users and subreddits. You can also insert a direct link into its search bar and head straight to the deleted post.</p><p>To use Reveddit, you should follow these steps:</p><p>Step1 Go to Reveddit.com</p><p>Step2 Type in a specific username, subreddit name, or simply insert the link of the deleted post</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/reveddit-search.png"                      alt="search bar on reveddit tool"                ></p><p>Step3 Click “Go” and it will display every deleted Reddit post within that search query</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/reveddit-results.png"                      alt="reveddit results page"                ></p><p>There’s one thing you need to remember about Reveddit. While it quickly shows deleted posts on Reddit, this only applies to posts and comments that were deleted by moderators or bots. So, if a user deleted their post, Reveddit won’t display that one in the results.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2094419/7443" target="_top" id="2094419">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2094419" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2094419/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Resavr"><a href="#3-Resavr" class="headerlink" title="3. Resavr"></a>3. Resavr</h3><p>Resavr is another simple tool that instantly displays deleted comments on Reddit.</p><p>It’s pretty similar to the other tools, except it only reveals comments, not Reddit posts. However, Resavr can display comments much longer than 650 words, while some tools can’t do this.</p><p>Here’s how to use this simple tool.

Unddit"></a>1. Unddit</h3><p>Unddit is a third-party tool that uses Pushshift.io. This is a database that stores comments users leave on Reddit.</p><p>The main reason Unddit is so popular and used is because of its simplicity. It is easy to use the tool and takes about 10 seconds to set it all up. Let’s go over the steps to use Unddit and reveal some deleted comments on Reddit.</p><p>Step1 First, go to <a class="link"   href="https://www.unddit.com/" >Unddit.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>Step2 Click on the red “Unddit” button and drag it to your bookmark bar</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/red-unddit-button.png"                      alt="unddit button pointing to bookmark"                ></p><p>Step3 Go to the deleted Reddit post</p><p>Step4 Click on the Unddit bookmark you just saved</p><p>This will automatically lead you to a new page. There, Unddit analyses and displays all the deleted comments from that post.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/unddit-results.png"                      alt="results page on unddit tool"                ></p><p>On the downside, Reddit doesn’t work well with most Reddit posts. It’s more effective for revealing deleted comments. Additionally, it may show an error from time to time. Unfortunately, the reason isn’t always displayed, and it’s something we need to live with.</p><h3 id="2-Reveddit-1"><a href="#2-Reveddit-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Reveddit"></a>2. Reveddit</h3><p>Unlike Unddit, Reveddit will always help you find deleted Reddit posts. It’s a powerful tool and much more stable compared to so many others out there.</p><p>This tool tracks Reddit activity in real-time. For example, you can use it to track deleted posts from specific users and subreddits. You can also insert a direct link into its search bar and head straight to the deleted post.</p><p>To use Reveddit, you should follow these steps:</p><p>Step1 Go to Reveddit.com</p><p>Step2 Type in a specific username, subreddit name, or simply insert the link of the deleted post</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/reveddit-search.png"                      alt="search bar on reveddit tool"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/857869/11832" target="_top" id="857869">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-857869" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/857869/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step3 Click “Go” and it will display every deleted Reddit post within that search query</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/reveddit-results.png"                      alt="reveddit results page"                ></p><p>There’s one thing you need to remember about Reveddit. While it quickly shows deleted posts on Reddit, this only applies to posts and comments that were deleted by moderators or bots. So, if a user deleted their post, Reveddit won’t display that one in the results.</p><h3 id="3-Resavr-1"><a href="#3-Resavr-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Resavr"></a>3. Resavr</h3><p>Resavr is another simple tool that instantly displays deleted comments on Reddit.</p><p>It’s pretty similar to the other tools, except it only reveals comments, not Reddit posts. However, Resavr can display comments much longer than 650 words, while some tools can’t do this.</p><p>Here’s how to use this simple tool. It only takes a few seconds:</p><p>Step1 Go to Resavr.com</p><p>Step2 Type in a keyword in the top-right corner search bar</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/resavr-search-bar.png"                      alt="resavr home page"                ></p><p>Step3 It will display a list of Google results with Reddit posts that have deleted comments</p><p>The main disadvantage of Resavr is its search feature.

This model is designed to be a high-caliber Pro selection and a regular use work monitor that has all of the specs necessary for a variety of digital work tasks.

This is the type of monitor that you can use for ergonomic support day in and day out. The overall design style is made from modern office and it can be made to fit in almost any environment. Including eight ergonomic swivel, pivot, height adjustment and more is an ideal choice for many professionals who are looking for a monitor that they can use for preventing neck strain and improving long working hours each day.</p><p> The look of this monitor also comes with a beautiful logo that improves the branding of the monitor as well as strong materials all finished in matte black. This matte black construction really helps to improve the look of the monitor overall and to make sure that it can fade into almost any office setting. The cabinet finish features a 10 mm bezel which is not too distracting and ensures that if multiple monitors needed to be used for one workstation this could be done quite easily. Overall the monitor size is great and with the design of the adjustments it’s really easy to enjoy a functional design that goes far beyond the average 32 inch television or large display. The comfort adjustments on this make it perfect for professionals.</p><p> The stand and base are manufactured and extremely minimalist design which is functional yet extremely strong and study. This ensures that the entire unit can stand up quite well in a large office or across many cubicles and hours of work. The PA329Q is known for being adjustable in every way that an ASUS is providing for all of its 4 k monitors. If you have used one of these monitors in the past they can be extremely comfortable over long uses making them ideal for a workplace setting.</p><h4 id="2-Ports-and-Connectivity"><a href="#2-Ports-and-Connectivity" class="headerlink" title="2.

While most of the ports can be easily viewed by tilting the monitor, sometimes it can be difficult to plug items in for connectivity without first raising the monitor up or even tilting it all the way down. Once you have the monitor configured and everything plugged in, it’s quite easy to use for day to day operations.</p><p> The overall design of the ports and the location of these ports is for a minimalist design with the look of many items, such as cords and empty ports hidden away from view. Most of the settings and button features can be found along the side of the monitor where they can sometimes be hidden from view. When using the monitor in portrait mode these ports become much more accessible. For most high-end monitors, these types of ports are expected but it’s tough to find too many monitors that have such a wealth of ports available for use at one time.</p><h2 id="Features-and-Performance"><a href="#Features-and-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Features and Performance"></a>Features and Performance</h2><h4 id="1-OSD-and-Settings"><a href="#1-OSD-and-Settings" class="headerlink" title="1.OSD and Settings"></a>1.OSD and Settings</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/asus-proart-pa329q-osd.jpg"                      alt="asus-proart-pa329q-osd"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136626/26400" target="_top" id="2136626">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136626" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136626/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> The overall settings are handled by joystick navigation through the large OSD. There are many color options including quick fit resolution, a full menu of color options, input selections, blue light filters calibration tools and more. For the most part, calibration can be done with splendid menus which are available just out of the box. Additional features can also be found throughout the menu to improve connectivity and the use of the menus throughout usage. There is even an option to create alignments based off of actual paper sizes so that you can create very precise editing and proofing on documents before they print.</p><p> There are eight different picture modes available throughout the settings including sRBG, Adobe RPG and a variety of other factory settings. Putting locks into the brightness as well as color can make sure that full adjustments stay through multiple shifts and working conditions. Blue light filters also come with four different options ensuring that you can get compensation based off of the types of color settings you work best with. The color menu adjustments include sliders for all six colors and under the advanced submenu, there are some fine tuning adjustments that you won’t find on many other types of professional monitors.</p><p> The remaining types of picture controls can be found throughout the image submenu which allows for adjustments in sharpness, overscan, aspect control toggles and more. The Vivid Pixel enhancement option also allows for improved contrast between dark and light objects across the screen. The dynamic feature will improve the range of shadows for animation work for example.</p><h4 id="2-Color-and-Image-Quality"><a href="#2-Color-and-Image-Quality" class="headerlink" title="2.

There are color spaces for video editing in 2020 as well as true to life color reproduction.</p><p> What’s really incredible with the color and image quality is the full customization that is available to professionals. Through the menus, it’s possible to change brightness settings, calibrate for animation and improved contrast as well as deliver improved support for working within Adobe and other video editing and production suites.</p><p> This device can produce 1.0 7 billion colors with the chance to produce over 1024 shades of each primary color. The screen is made up of a 10-bit panel and there is a 14-bit lookup table for a huge color gamut. There is also amazing gamma correction and color recalculation to represent the differences between colors and to finally produce a true to life image based off of the closest specifications and measurements on a print product.</p><p> Overall the image quality and color quality is perfect especially when the settings are dialed in the only aspect where this monitor falls short however is with brightness uniformity. Even many of the top Asus monitors find difficulty with uniformity compensation throughout the monitor face and this makes brightness at a fixed level of premium. The pure resolution and the size of the monitor ensures that pixels are close to invisible and the antiglare matte coating on the monitor makes it easy to read and easy to see colors in a variety of different lighting settings.</p><h4 id="3-Calibration"><a href="#3-Calibration" class="headerlink" title="3. Calibration"></a>3. Calibration</h4><p> Overall this monitor is extremely easy to work on right out-of-the-box. The calibration technology on ASUS however has always been a cut above. The PA329Q delivers DCI PIII color space support. The device also comes with a factory data calibration sheet ensuring that artists and creative professionals can calibrate specifically for Adobe RGB modes, s RGB modes and the latest in industry standards. The ASUS proARt calibration technology software also comes with all of the latest presets for editing software worldwide. New standards and improvements can be constantly fed through the software to ensure improved performance results.</p><p> As well as the features the color calibration tools that ASUS included just in the menu with the PA329Q make it extremely easy to calibrate in its multiple picture modes as well as through advanced settings that can all be found on the monitor.</p><h4 id="4-Eye-Care-Mode"><a href="#4-Eye-Care-Mode" class="headerlink" title="4.Eye Care Mode"></a>4.Eye Care Mode</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/asus-proart-pa329q-protect-flicker.jpg"                      alt="asus-proart-pa329q-protect-flicker"                ></p><p> In eye care mode the Asus offers a flicker free operation with a low blue light. The idea of this type of technology is to produce a beautiful image quality with very high refresh rates. This can work to protect the eyes over a long shift and prevent dry eye symptoms that are common amongst design and image editing professionals. This type of technology is an ASUS only creation and it shows they are willing to go a step beyond for creative professionals.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> Overall this is a top quality professional monitor due to both of its performance, the hardware and the amazing amount of settings that are available under the hood.

There is also amazing gamma correction and color recalculation to represent the differences between colors and to finally produce a true to life image based off of the closest specifications and measurements on a print product.</p><p> Overall the image quality and color quality is perfect especially when the settings are dialed in the only aspect where this monitor falls short however is with brightness uniformity. Even many of the top Asus monitors find difficulty with uniformity compensation throughout the monitor face and this makes brightness at a fixed level of premium. The pure resolution and the size of the monitor ensures that pixels are close to invisible and the antiglare matte coating on the monitor makes it easy to read and easy to see colors in a variety of different lighting settings.</p><h4 id="3-Calibration-3"><a href="#3-Calibration-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

Most video editors apply video effects to their artwork for different purposes. Nowadays, videos without effects will probably cause a decrease in audience and supporters. To prevent that, editors keep seeking the best video effects for their videos.</p><p>There are many sources of video effects. Some are included in the video editing software, and you can find some on the internet. There are also video effects that can give a more realistic effect, which is probably a premium one, and you need to spend money to get that video effect in your hands. But if you don’t want to spend money seeking video effects, this article will significantly help you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/free-video-effects.jpg"                      alt="free video effects"                ></p><p>This composition will give you some information on how you will be able to download video effects without spending money.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">How does VFX differ from SFX?</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">When to use SFX</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">When to use VFX</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">How to Get Free Video Effects?</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Pixabay.com</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-2">Pexels.com</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-3">Mixkit.co</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-4">Videezy.com</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-5">Videvo.net</a></li></ol><h2 id="What-are-Video-Effects"><a href="#What-are-Video-Effects" class="headerlink" title="What are Video Effects?"></a>What are Video Effects?</h2><p>The acronym VFX stands for video effects. The term “visual effects,” also known as “VFX,” refers to all types of digitally enhanced pictures, from adding backdrops using greenscreen to incorporating GGI models and entities. In filmmaking and video production, visual effects refer to how imagery is created or altered outside of a live-action shot.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144273/7443" target="_top" id="2144273">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144273" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144273/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="How-does-VFX-differ-from-SFX"><a href="#How-does-VFX-differ-from-SFX" class="headerlink" title="How does VFX differ from SFX?"></a>How does VFX differ from SFX?</h3><p>These concepts are frequently ambiguous; therefore, we wanted to examine this subject in greater detail to clarify any misunderstandings.</p><p>Usually, you can infer from the context which “kind” of VFX is being discussed. When debates about when to employ one method over another or whether to use both ways to accomplish an effect in a shot emerge, SFX and VFX are frequently used jointly in a production.</p><p>Both SFX and VFX are tools that let you strengthen your story’s narrative. Your production will probably require either or both of the solutions mentioned earlier. How, though, can you tell which is best for your project?</p><h3 id="When-to-use-SFX"><a href="#When-to-use-SFX" class="headerlink" title="When to use SFX"></a>When to use SFX</h3><p>Special effects transport viewers to a simpler era of movie and television production. SFX was used—and is frequently still used—to improve a scene or set piece. Things that might occur haphazardly in real life but need careful planning on the set include an explosion, fire, or a rainy day in a love story. On-set special effects are frequently used to generate snow, rain or to add smoke to a scene. The addition of fire, either to decorate sets or to be employed in a stunt involving people, is another component of the SFX skill set.</p><h3 id="When-to-use-VFX"><a href="#When-to-use-VFX" class="headerlink" title="When to use VFX"></a>When to use VFX</h3><p>Then why would you need to use digitally created snow, fire, rain, or other effects as VFX if SFX recorded on camera are so effective?</p><p>It might be one scenario if you had a larger canvas to fill and more images to take. Using VFX to produce a snowy landscape with expansive views will be simpler and less expensive. The same holds with rain.</p><p>Then it would be best if you contemplate the circumstances that exist on-set. If you add smoke to a scene to help it come to life—say, a fight scene in a historical drama—the wind may blow it away, or it might not “behave” the way you want it to. You will then require VFX smoke. On-set SFX cannot be “ordered” to act in a manner that the director, production crew, or writers deem appropriate for the plot.</p><p>Another problem is that artificial snow and set smoke can occasionally make actors unresponsive. Snow machines aren’t always suited for every situation because they may also be pretty noisy.</p><h2 id="How-to-Get-Free-Video-Effects"><a href="#How-to-Get-Free-Video-Effects" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Free Video Effects?"></a>How to Get Free Video Effects?</h2><p>Video effects are primarily included in your downloaded video editing software. But if you just downloaded a free video editing software, the video effects included are usually limited and sometimes superficial. Many video editing software offers premium video effects, which is undoubtedly not disappointing, but you have to spend money for a subscription to unlock all the features of that software.</p><p>This composition will show you how to get free video effects from different websites.

The term “visual effects,” also known as “VFX,” refers to all types of digitally enhanced pictures, from adding backdrops using greenscreen to incorporating GGI models and entities. In filmmaking and video production, visual effects refer to how imagery is created or altered outside of a live-action shot.</p><h3 id="How-does-VFX-differ-from-SFX-1"><a href="#How-does-VFX-differ-from-SFX-1" class="headerlink" title="How does VFX differ from SFX?"></a>How does VFX differ from SFX?</h3><p>These concepts are frequently ambiguous; therefore, we wanted to examine this subject in greater detail to clarify any misunderstandings.</p><p>Usually, you can infer from the context which “kind” of VFX is being discussed. When debates about when to employ one method over another or whether to use both ways to accomplish an effect in a shot emerge, SFX and VFX are frequently used jointly in a production.</p><p>Both SFX and VFX are tools that let you strengthen your story’s narrative. Your production will probably require either or both of the solutions mentioned earlier. How, though, can you tell which is best for your project?</p><h3 id="When-to-use-SFX-1"><a href="#When-to-use-SFX-1" class="headerlink" title="When to use SFX"></a>When to use SFX</h3><p>Special effects transport viewers to a simpler era of movie and television production. SFX was used—and is frequently still used—to improve a scene or set piece. Things that might occur haphazardly in real life but need careful planning on the set include an explosion, fire, or a rainy day in a love story. On-set special effects are frequently used to generate snow, rain or to add smoke to a scene. The addition of fire, either to decorate sets or to be employed in a stunt involving people, is another component of the SFX skill set.</p><h3 id="When-to-use-VFX-1"><a href="#When-to-use-VFX-1" class="headerlink" title="When to use VFX"></a>When to use VFX</h3><p>Then why would you need to use digitally created snow, fire, rain, or other effects as VFX if SFX recorded on camera are so effective?</p><p>It might be one scenario if you had a larger canvas to fill and more images to take. Using VFX to produce a snowy landscape with expansive views will be simpler and less expensive. The same holds with rain.</p><p>Then it would be best if you contemplate the circumstances that exist on-set. If you add smoke to a scene to help it come to life—say, a fight scene in a historical drama—the wind may blow it away, or it might not “behave” the way you want it to. You will then require VFX smoke. On-set SFX cannot be “ordered” to act in a manner that the director, production crew, or writers deem appropriate for the plot.</p><p>Another problem is that artificial snow and set smoke can occasionally make actors unresponsive. Snow machines aren’t always suited for every situation because they may also be pretty noisy.</p><h2 id="How-to-Get-Free-Video-Effects-1"><a href="#How-to-Get-Free-Video-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Free Video Effects?"></a>How to Get Free Video Effects?</h2><p>Video effects are primarily included in your downloaded video editing software. But if you just downloaded a free video editing software, the video effects included are usually limited and sometimes superficial. Many video editing software offers premium video effects, which is undoubtedly not disappointing, but you have to spend money for a subscription to unlock all the features of that software.</p><p>This composition will show you how to get free video effects from different websites. Remember that it is free, so you should not expect more because, you know, the cooler and more realistic the video effect, the greater its value.</p><h3 id="1-Pixabay-com-1"><a href="#1-Pixabay-com-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

Being a successful video editor is not based on how much money you spend on your work or how premium the video effects you use. It depends on your strategy, how you utilize all your resources and deliver the story perfectly to the audience, and how you want it to be. I hope this article contributes to your knowledge of getting free video effects.

However, pulling off a successful live stream is quite challenging. You will have to get your script correct at the go, there are audio problems, and network issues are not ruled out. Where it all gets messed up is that you can’t edit if you make mistakes or an issue can slightly disrupt your stream. So, you have to be extra careful to do it successfully.</p><p>Fortunately, with the OneStream live streaming tool, you may not need to worry much because you can successfully and efficiently live stream a pre-recorded video.

How to live stream with Online OneStream"></a>Part 3. How to live stream with Online OneStream</h2><p>Live streaming with OneStream is pretty straightforward. I will walk you through a series of steps you can follow to live stream using OneStream successfully.</p><p>Step1 First, head to <a class="link"   href="https://app.onestream.live/signup" >OneStream live website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and create an account. Just input a username, password, and email address. After that, you need to choose a plan. OneStream offers 4 plans, as I have mentioned above. Just go through the plan features and choose the one that best suits you.</p><p>Step2 After you have successfully picked a plan, on the dashboard, you will see 40 top social platforms, and you will be requested to add your social accounts. If you can’t see the social platform you want to live stream to, you can use custom RTMP to stream it. Except for Instagram, you can connect all of your social accounts directly.</p><p>To connect your Instagram account, you must utilize a third-party software called Instafeed. Instead, it will construct your Instagram account’s Sync URL. Once the URL is generated, please copy and paste it into the OneStream Sync URL section. It will successfully connect your Instagram account to OneStream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/live-stream-with-onestream-1.jpg"                      alt="connect onstream to your social accounts"                ></p><p>Step3 To schedule your live stream on the dashboard, click the “three-line” button.

Past experiments have shown that the age group from 2-12 suffers from the sickness and it reportedly decreases till the age of 21. The cycle then starts again in the late 50’s. We are now in a dire need of ways to get rid of the sickness in order to fully experience the VR systems and make them user friendly. According to Popular Science, VR sickness and general VR discomfort are currently among the biggest hurdles to overcome before VR is comfortably adopted by the mass market. Scientists have set their goals upon making the VR system a true hit towards the end of this year. The highlights say that the scientists have found ways to eliminate virtual reality sickness, making 2017 to be ‘the year of Virtual Reality’. Until then we can adopt some careful set of rules to avoid that nauseous feeling during the game.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Lock your eyes:</strong> When we move around in real life, our eyes do not run in parallel with our body. So the same should happen inside the virtual environment. Locking your eyes at a fixed point while turning in a game can avoid the issue.</p></li><li><p><strong>Chew a gum:</strong> To stay in a virtual environment for long, a chewing gum might just help. The repetitive jaw movement can help you tackle some of the effects of virtual reality sickness.</p></li><li><p>**Take a break:**You need to remind your brain that you are not actually moving. Take a break when you are experiencing virtual reality. Stare at the wall or some stationary point. Time to time breaks can put your brain to ease.</p></li><li><p><strong>Deep breaths:</strong> No matter how exciting the game is, do not let your body and brain drift along excitement. Control your breathing in order to control the influence of virtual reality sickness.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lower the brightness.</strong>  Some users say that lowering the brightness can help you reduce the sickness level. Some games have brightness adjuster that you can use to your choice.</p></li><li><p>**Do not to move your head a lot.**Since motion sickness is connected to movement, reducing your head movement left and right and up and down in one place can help you.</p></li><li><p><strong>Avoid moving backwards and strafing.</strong>  If it’s a fast paced game that you are playing it is quite usual for you to want to use strafing to avoid bullets hitting you.</p></li><li><p>**Properly adjust the head gear.**Make sure your head gear fits you perfectly so there isn’t any calibration problem.</p></li></ol><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://jalbum-affiliate-program.sjv.io/c/5597632/1584040/17916" target="_top" id="1584040">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17916-1584040" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://jalbum-affiliate-program.sjv.io/i/5597632/1584040/17916"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="What-is-Virtual-reality-sickness"><a href="#What-is-Virtual-reality-sickness" class="headerlink" title="What is Virtual reality sickness?"></a>What is Virtual reality sickness?</h2><p> All we know about the reality of the real world around us is that it comes from the perception of our sensory organs and their co-relation with the sense-managing system of our brain to generate useful information. Thus if we present our sensory system with the kind of information that really isn’t there our brain would begin to explore it and comprehend it as reality to us. Such a type of self-made information and the resulting outcome is what we call ‘virtual reality’.</p><p> You can definitely not deny all the fun you can have with this new technology once you grab on all the cool gadgets and gears. Putting on a virtual reality headset can take you to a completely different world but would it really be fun when you have to vomit after ten minutes? Virtual reality sickness is a big hurdle to the widespread use of the virtual reality technology. The fact that ‘with virtual reality comes the sickness’ has been a major worry factor to the developers and scientists. Virtual Reality sickness brings along symptoms such as headaches, nausea, vomiting, discomfort, sweating, drowsiness, disorientation and apathy. Virtual reality sickness, however, is not a new problem. It has been known since the test pilots, test drivers and astronauts have been practicing their skills in simulators and mock vehicles.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144299/7443" target="_top" id="2144299">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144299" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144299/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-virtual-reality-make-people-sickness"><a href="#Why-virtual-reality-make-people-sickness" class="headerlink" title="Why virtual reality make people sickness"></a>Why virtual reality make people sickness</h2><p> Now the question arises, what is really making us sick? Is it the gadgets or gears? Or some manufacturing flaw? The link connecting virtual reality and the sickness, lies within the human body itself. When you are in a virtual environment, in some cases, your body’s sense of balance does not completely line up with the movements of your head. Also, when the environment around you moves, but your body stays stationary you experience dizziness or nausea. Typically, the bigger the mismatch the worse the sickness. According to the statement delivered by a military pilot, when you go inside a simulator, the movements don’t exactly match the same as they do in the real world, and all of a sudden, what you feel is just not right. Another reason causing the problem is based on virtual reality games and other such systems. In such a VR system you experience environment larger than the room you are in. All these factors can ultimately drive you sick!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123730/7443" target="_top" id="2123730">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123730" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123730/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-steps-to-eliminate-the-obs-blank-screens-in-gaming-setup/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Steps to Eliminate the OBS Blank Screens in Gaming Setup</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-elevating-video-previews-a-compreayer-approach-for-youtube-for-2024/"><u>[New] Elevating Video Previews A Compreayer Approach for YouTube for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/updated-capturing-movie-scenes-as-single-image-snapshots-windows-10/"><u>[Updated] Capturing Movie Scenes as Single Image Snapshots (Windows 10)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-skys-the-limit-for-your-shots-blend-free-space-and-premium-subscriptions/"><u>[Updated] Sky's the Limit for Your Shots Blend Free Space and Premium Subscriptions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-compreeved-guide-youtube-to-mp3mpeg-transcoding/"><u>2024 Approved Compreeved Guide YouTube to MP3/MPEG Transcoding</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/9-uncharted-upscales-for-vivid-visuals-for-2024/"><u>9 Uncharted Upscales for Vivid Visuals for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/crafting-cinematic-experiences-with-magix-video-pro-x/"><u>Crafting Cinematic Experiences with Magix Video Pro X</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/easypodstream-how-to-set-up-and-broadcast-with-minimal-hassle/"><u>EasyPodStream How To Set Up and Broadcast with Minimal Hassle</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/exclusive-performers-webcasts/"><u>Exclusive Performers' Webcasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://solve-helper.techidaily.com/how-to-convert-and-upload-videos-in-unsupported-formats-with-lightworks/"><u>How to Convert and Upload Videos in Unsupported Formats with Lightworks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/how-to-update-apple-iphone-se-2022-without-losing-any-data-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/"><u>How to Update Apple iPhone SE (2022) without Losing Any Data? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/monetizing-your-youtube-content-costing/"><u>Monetizing Your YouTube Content Costing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/prodigious-portfolio-creation-best-free-mac-software/"><u>Prodigious Portfolio Creation Best FREE Mac Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/secrets-to-more-likes-on-your-tiktok-unpacks/"><u>Secrets to More Likes on Your TikTok Unpacks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/top-10-fixes-for-phone-keep-disconnecting-from-wi-fi-on-motorola-edge-40-pro-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Top 10 Fixes for Phone Keep Disconnecting from Wi-Fi On Motorola Edge 40 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/top-edits-made-easy-a-newbies-guide-to-video-trimming-and-enhancing-for-2024/"><u>Top Edits Made Easy A Newbie's Guide to Video Trimming & Enhancing for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/what-legendaries-are-in-pokemon-platinum-on-itel-p40-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>What Legendaries Are In Pokemon Platinum On Itel P40? | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Even though CPU still plays a large role in how smoothly your computer displays the videos in the video editing software, the computer’s GPU can decrease the rendering times or enhance the playback of large 4K files significantly. So, here are some background information on graphics cards.</p><h3 id="What-is-a-Graphics-Card-2"><a href="#What-is-a-Graphics-Card-2" class="headerlink" title="What is a Graphics Card?"></a>What is a Graphics Card?</h3><p>A graphics card or a video card is a piece of computer hardware that produces the steam of output images you can see on a computer’s monitor or any other display device. All computers feature a graphics card because without them it would be impossible to run even the most basic applications like word processors or web browsers.</p><h3 id="What-are-the-Most-Common-Types-of-Graphics-Cards-2"><a href="#What-are-the-Most-Common-Types-of-Graphics-Cards-2" class="headerlink" title="What are the Most Common Types of Graphics Cards?"></a>What are the Most Common Types of Graphics Cards?</h3><p>There are two common types of graphics cards. Most computers have an <strong>integrated graphics card</strong> that is located on the same chip as the CPU, which enables you to edit photos, watch and edit videos or play video games. However, GPUs and CPUs that are located on the same chip often limit each other’s capabilities, and as a result, the computer needs more time to perform demanding tasks.</p><p>Installing a <strong>dedicated graphics card</strong> to your computer will eliminate lagging and it will allow you to edit videos in high resolution faster or reduce the amount of time that is required to render a 4K video. All dedicated graphics cards come with a separate chip and a separate RAM that reduces the strain of a computer’s CPU and minimizes the lagging of the footage during the video editing process.</p><p>Whether or not getting a dedicated graphics card will prove to be a good investment depends on the tasks you perform regularly on your computer. If you only edit photos and videos at a basic level, then the integrated graphics card is all you need.</p><p>Nonetheless, if you are a professional animator, video editor or simply want to play all the latest games in maximum resolution, a dedicated graphics card is going to make routine tasks you perform on your computer every day much easier and faster.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148648/16836" target="_top" id="2148648">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148648" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148648/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Which-Factors-to-Consider-While-Choosing-a-Graphics-Card-2"><a href="#Which-Factors-to-Consider-While-Choosing-a-Graphics-Card-2" class="headerlink" title="Which Factors to Consider While Choosing a Graphics Card?"></a>Which Factors to Consider While Choosing a Graphics Card?</h3><p>Currently, there are hundreds of different dedicated graphics card models on the market, and finding the one that is the best fit for your computer’s configuration can take some time and research.

Even though CPU still plays a large role in how smoothly your computer displays the videos in the video editing software, the computer’s GPU can decrease the rendering times or enhance the playback of large 4K files significantly. So, here are some background information on graphics cards.</p><h3 id="What-is-a-Graphics-Card-3"><a href="#What-is-a-Graphics-Card-3" class="headerlink" title="What is a Graphics Card?"></a>What is a Graphics Card?</h3><p>A graphics card or a video card is a piece of computer hardware that produces the steam of output images you can see on a computer’s monitor or any other display device. All computers feature a graphics card because without them it would be impossible to run even the most basic applications like word processors or web browsers.</p><h3 id="What-are-the-Most-Common-Types-of-Graphics-Cards-3"><a href="#What-are-the-Most-Common-Types-of-Graphics-Cards-3" class="headerlink" title="What are the Most Common Types of Graphics Cards?"></a>What are the Most Common Types of Graphics Cards?</h3><p>There are two common types of graphics cards. Most computers have an <strong>integrated graphics card</strong> that is located on the same chip as the CPU, which enables you to edit photos, watch and edit videos or play video games. However, GPUs and CPUs that are located on the same chip often limit each other’s capabilities, and as a result, the computer needs more time to perform demanding tasks.</p><p>Installing a <strong>dedicated graphics card</strong> to your computer will eliminate lagging and it will allow you to edit videos in high resolution faster or reduce the amount of time that is required to render a 4K video. All dedicated graphics cards come with a separate chip and a separate RAM that reduces the strain of a computer’s CPU and minimizes the lagging of the footage during the video editing process.</p><p>Whether or not getting a dedicated graphics card will prove to be a good investment depends on the tasks you perform regularly on your computer. If you only edit photos and videos at a basic level, then the integrated graphics card is all you need.</p><p>Nonetheless, if you are a professional animator, video editor or simply want to play all the latest games in maximum resolution, a dedicated graphics card is going to make routine tasks you perform on your computer every day much easier and faster.</p><h3 id="Which-Factors-to-Consider-While-Choosing-a-Graphics-Card-3"><a href="#Which-Factors-to-Consider-While-Choosing-a-Graphics-Card-3" class="headerlink" title="Which Factors to Consider While Choosing a Graphics Card?"></a>Which Factors to Consider While Choosing a Graphics Card?</h3><p>Currently, there are hundreds of different dedicated graphics card models on the market, and finding the one that is the best fit for your computer’s configuration can take some time and research. Besides checking your computer’s specifications there are a few more aspects you must consider before you purchase a dedicated graphics card.</p><h4 id="1-Power-draw-3"><a href="#1-Power-draw-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Power draw"></a>1. Power draw</h4><p>A stable power source is important for all computer configurations, as it helps you avoid system crashes and hardware malfunctions. The power usage of dedicated graphics cards varies from model to model and it can range from just 120 Watts to 300 Watts. In fact, high-end graphics cards consume as much power as all other computer components combined, and you must ensure that your computer’s power supply can provide enough power.</p><h4 id="2-Cooling-3"><a href="#2-Cooling-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Cooling"></a>2. Cooling</h4><p>Overheating can cause irreparable damage to the graphics card and to your computer, so checking the cooling capabilities of the card you would like to get can help you reduce the risk of failure in the long run. Furthermore, cooling fans on dedicated graphics cards can produce noise, and you must check if the model you’re interested in can operate at low noise levels.</p><h4 id="3-Size-3"><a href="#3-Size-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Size"></a>3. Size</h4><p>The length of most high-end dedicated graphics cards is between 10.5 and 11-inches, which can occupy two or three expansion slots. That is why you must check how many expansion slots you have at your disposal and check the size of the graphics card before you purchase it.</p><h4 id="4-Multi-card-scaling-3"><a href="#4-Multi-card-scaling-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Multi-card scaling"></a>4. Multi-card scaling</h4><p>The available space and the size can also impact your multi-card scaling options, since connecting two or more graphics cards can take a lot of space. AMD and Nvidia can be connected via CrossFire X or NVLink, but pairing graphics cards that have different architectures is not possible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997675/19272" target="_top" id="1997675">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997675" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997675/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-youtube-monetization-tips-how-many-views-do-you-really-need-to-make-money/"><u>[New] YouTube Monetization Tips How Many Views Do You Really Need to Make Money</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-cost-efficient-pc-video-harvesters/"><u>[Updated] Cost-Efficient PC Video Harvesters</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-cost-effective-aerospace-for-huge-datasets-at-low-rates/"><u>2024 Approved Cost-Effective AeroSpace for Huge Datasets at Low Rates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/5-ways-to-reset-oppo-reno-11f-5g-without-volume-buttons-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/"><u>5 Ways to Reset Oppo Reno 11F 5G Without Volume Buttons | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/a-deep-dive-into-panasonics-hx-a1-camera-features-for-2024/"><u>A Deep Dive Into Panasonic's HX-A1 Camera Features for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/add-and-record-audio-to-powerpoint/"><u>Add & Record Audio to PowerPoint</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/aerial-mastery-reviewed-the-essence-of-gopro-karma-for-2024/"><u>Aerial Mastery Reviewed The Essence of GoPro Karma for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/cease-chromes-automatic-conversion-to-webp-format-pc-users/"><u>Cease Chrome’s Automatic Conversion to WebP Format PC Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/crafting-your-virtual-identity-essential-tech-you-need-top-7/"><u>Crafting Your Virtual Identity - Essential Tech You Need (Top 7)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/decoding-whatsapps-audio-transmission-techniques/"><u>Decoding WhatsApp's Audio Transmission Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/download-and-play-with-ifunnys-meme-magic/"><u>Download and Play with iFunny's Meme Magic</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/enhance-image-edges-with-circular-smear-technique-ps/"><u>Enhance Image Edges with Circular Smear Technique PS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/enhance-your-captures-online-a-compact-guide-to-best-photo-fixers/"><u>Enhance Your Captures Online A Compact Guide to Best Photo Fixers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/fix-vivo-x90s-android-system-webview-crash-2024-issue-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Fix Vivo X90S Android System Webview Crash 2024 Issue | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/top-4-ios-game-boy-advance-portals-to-classic-worlds/"><u>Top 4 iOS Game Boy Advance Portals to Classic Worlds</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-able.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-guide-dealing-with-unstable-wallpaper-engine-on-windows-11-10-systems/"><u>Troubleshooting Guide: Dealing with Unstable Wallpaper Engine on Windows 11, 10 Systems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-steps-to-solve-your-logitech-mouses-latency-issues/"><u>Troubleshooting Steps to Solve Your Logitech Mouse's Latency Issues</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Although the power of storytelling has existed for thousands of years, it has only recently become possible for storytellers to <strong>“become digital”</strong> because of the advancement of personal computers and friendly modern communications.</p><p>High goals and outdated technologies coexisted throughout this period. Browsers were quite straightforward at the time, and dial-up remained still in use.

The iPhone can be an excellent tool for anyone wishing to produce outstanding music videos on a limited budget thanks to the device’s powerful camera features. To get the best results possible, it’s wise to use a tripod, find out more about how your iPhone works, enlist the services of a director and use professional editing software. Read on to find out more about making iPhone music videos.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: Using a tripod</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Know the technical details of your iPhone</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: If possible, hire a video director</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Edit on your computer</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-Using-a-tripod"><a href="#Part-1-Using-a-tripod" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Using a tripod"></a>Part 1: Using a tripod</h2><p> Footage shot with hand-held iPhones can be jerky, blurry and difficult to watch. To achieve the required level of stability, it’s a great idea to use a tripod. A tripod will help you produce a high-quality music video with a stable picture. Make sure you use a compact tripod that is easy to carry and operate to get the best results.</p><p> A tripod will help you if you are shooting static footage, but if you wish to move around whilst you are recording and still obtain outstanding footage you can use a gimbal. Gimbals are much more affordable than they once were and are ideal for vloggers in particular as well as those shooting action-fuelled scenes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jellyfish-metal-spring-tripod.jpg"                      alt="tripod"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135400/19272" target="_top" id="2135400">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135400" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135400/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Know-the-technical-details-of-your-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-Know-the-technical-details-of-your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Know the technical details of your iPhone"></a>Part 2: Know the technical details of your iPhone</h2><p> You can record HD video with your rear-facing camera once you have read up on how to do so. The iPhone allows you to shoot 4K video, and you can even determine the number of frames per second you want to capture, in order to create smooth, hi-resolution footage. As long as you have the iPhone 6 or above and it is running on at least iOS 9, you’ll be able to capture 4K footage.</p><p> To enable 4K shooting, you must head to your settings and request it. You can do this by clicking through to Settings &gt; Camera and tapping either Record Video or Record Slow-mo. You can then select the required resolution from the options on your screen. You do need to remember that higher resolutions take up more space on your device. For instance, 4K video at frames per second will require 400MB of space per minute, which is ten times more than 720 HD at 30fps. However, by creating the necessary space, you can obtain outstandingly crisp footage for your music video. You can reduce the level of space needed by choosing 4K at 24fps (135MB per minute) or at 30fps (170MB).</p><p> If you wish to opt for slo-mo video recording, you can shoot in 1080p HD at 120fps (170MB per min) or 240fps (480MB). Whichever option you choose, make sure your device has sufficient space to avoid missing out on the exceptional footage that you require.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Shooting-iPhone.jpg"                      alt="iphone technical details"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144277/7443" target="_top" id="2144277">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144277" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144277/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-If-possible-hire-a-video-director"><a href="#Part-3-If-possible-hire-a-video-director" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: If possible, hire a video director"></a>Part 3: If possible, hire a video director</h2><p> No matter how confident you are working without a director, you can enhance the quality of your music video even further when you do hire one. A director can help you derive more value from your iPhone and use their knowledge of angles, lighting effects and much more to make the end results surpass your expectations. As you’ll be saving money by shooting your video with your iPhone, you can use the cash you have saved to send your video to the next level and make the outcome truly breathtaking.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/director.jpg"                      alt="director"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151889/7443" target="_top" id="2151889">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151889" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151889/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Edit-on-your-computer"><a href="#Part-4-Edit-on-your-computer" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Edit on your computer"></a>Part 4: Edit on your computer</h2><p> The hard work isn’t over once the shoot has come to an end. By using professional editing software, you can add all sorts of dazzling effects and edit the final piece together in a way that just won’t be possible when using your iPhone alone. Editing software solutions like Filmore offer a range of features to boost the quality of your video including inbuilt audio synthesisers and special video effects, enabling you to match your music with your images perfectly. There are many exceptional music video editing software packages on the market that are simple to use and easy to get to grips with, even if you have little or no existing editing experience. You will almost certainly achieve better results by editing your video using your PC rather than your iPhone.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148636/16836" target="_top" id="2148636">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148636" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148636/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> Many of us have dreamed of creating our own music videos to bring songs to life.

Let us now get the tips and techniques in detail for perfect silhouette photography with your iPhone.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1925565/19272" target="_top" id="1925565">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1925565" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1925565/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Tips"><a href="#Tips" class="headerlink" title="Tips"></a>Tips</h3><h4 id="1-Light-Source"><a href="#1-Light-Source" class="headerlink" title="1.  Light Source"></a>1.  Light Source</h4><p> Silhouette photography can be best done when the shot is taken against the source of light. The camera sensor generally fails to interpret the shadow details unlike a human eye. And therefore shooting against the light will help in providing the best silhouette effect. It simply implies keeping the subject against the sunlight or other source of light to get an automatic silhouette and shadowy effect. The most excellent way for emphasized and perfect silhouette photography is ensuring to shoot when there is low sunlight i.e. the time of sunrise and sunset.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/silouette-agiant-light.jpg"                      alt="silouette-agiant-light"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049379/7443" target="_top" id="2049379">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049379" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049379/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Image source: Digital Photo Secrets</p><h4 id="2-Low-POV"><a href="#2-Low-POV" class="headerlink" title="2.  Low POV"></a>2.  Low POV</h4><p> A yet another tip for silhouetting effect is capturing the view from a low angle. When you will get down a little lower and capture from a low angle, it will present the picture with a plain and simple background and there will be no clumsiness related to background. The photo taken from low point or by lying down on the ground will result in position changing of the subject and adding more interest to it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/silhouette-low-pov.jpg"                      alt="silhouette-low-pov"                ></p><p> Image source: Gettyimages</p><h4 id="3-Lucid-Backgrounds"><a href="#3-Lucid-Backgrounds" class="headerlink" title="3.  Lucid Backgrounds"></a>3.  Lucid Backgrounds</h4><p> Background is one of the chief things to be considered while doing any kind of photography. When you do iPhone silhouette snapping, a mess-free background is what you should take into account. Keeping sky as the background would be perfect choice and the silhouette photography will go perfect when there are clouds in the sky. The subject will acquire a really dramatic effect. Birds and trees are other suggestions for better backdrop of your picture. In short, you should always consider the background when you desire an ideal silhouetted photo. Also, low angle shoot will work here too.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/silouette-photo-simple-background.jpg"                      alt="silouette-photo-simple-background"                ></p><p> Image source: Pexels</p><h4 id="4-Space-is-Essential"><a href="#4-Space-is-Essential" class="headerlink" title="4.  Space is Essential"></a>4.  Space is Essential</h4><p> A very simple thing to keep in mind while going for silhouette photo moment is leaving enough space when the scene contains several subjects. This is important since it will become difficult to recognize the subject. For example, if there is a family silhouette photo, if you won’t give space, they will be difficult to identify separately in that shadowy effect. However, when shooting stationary subjects and they are very close, ensure a little change in the shooting angle. On the other hand, if shooting moving subjects, do it only when you feel a sufficient space between them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/silhouette-photo-space.jpg"                      alt="silhouette-photo-space"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105870/7443" target="_top" id="2105870">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105870" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105870/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Image source: astro-canada.ca</p><h4 id="5-Ensuring-Accurate-Focus-Exposure"><a href="#5-Ensuring-Accurate-Focus-Exposure" class="headerlink" title="5.  Ensuring Accurate Focus &amp; Exposure"></a>5.  Ensuring Accurate Focus &amp; Exposure</h4><p> When you decide to take an iPhone silhouette photo, please note that iPhone offers a sound exposure that can help creating a pleasing silhouette. The device’s exposure is set automatically to the subject. In case of silhouette photography, it can happen that your subject is relatively large and when the exposure is automatically set to the subject, your silhouette picture can be destroyed ultimately fading the background. Therefore, in this case, you can just tap on the background place which is ideally the brightest part like cloud in the sky. This will in turn give a silhouette effect. Hence, setting focus and exposure accurately is necessary for processing exceptional silhouette photography.</p><h4 id="6-Increase-contrast"><a href="#6-Increase-contrast" class="headerlink" title="6. Increase contrast"></a>6. Increase contrast</h4><p> You can also apply post-production concept to get the remarkable silhouette effect in your snaps. This takes a little moderation in the photography after when you click it. You can use adjustments for a better silhouette effect by adding fair amount of light levels or darkness and highlight your subject. For the adjustments, increasing the contrast would be a recommended option to make the silhouette look darker and brighter. On the other hand, you can use a little amount of vignette effect at the outer range of the photo. This will bring better attention to your subject at the center and will make your silhouette photography moment perfect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/silhouette-photo-contrast.jpg"                      alt="silhouette-photo-contrast"                ></p><p> Image source: Flickr</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-unveiling-the-ultimate-tools-for-high-quality-monitoring/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Unveiling the Ultimate Tools for High-Quality Monitoring</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-pioneering-gear-for-ultimate-vr-glove-experience/"><u>[New] Pioneering Gear for Ultimate VR Glove Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-transforming-movies-to-still-moments-with-windows-10-photo-viewer/"><u>[New] Transforming Movies to Still Moments with Windows 10 Photo Viewer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-hovers.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-smile-saver-essential-free-meme-templates/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Smile Saver Essential Free Meme Templates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/updated-choose-right-gopro-hero5-vs-garmin-virb-updated-22/"><u>[Updated] Choose Right GoPro Hero5 Vs.

To solve this, SDR to HDR conversion or vice versa can be one of the best solutions. So let’s take a further look at the available options to create amazing upconversions.</em></p><h2 id="Can-I-convert-the-SDR-video-to-HDR"><a href="#Can-I-convert-the-SDR-video-to-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Can I convert the SDR video to HDR?"></a>Can I convert the SDR video to HDR?</h2><p>Before diving into concrete steps, it’s best to have a decent understanding of how it works. Changing from SDR to HDR is possible, but with specific sequences, the results can vary accordingly. Of course, the video’s original quality would influence how it looks in the final outcome, even if you convert it into the high dynamic range or HDR version.</p><p>The camera noise and compression artifacts that are available in the video file will become more enhanced after the upconverting process. This means more clean-up work during and after the processing will become necessary. So, <strong>converting SDR to HDR</strong> successfully from the source file will not change entirely in some methods.</p><p>Given all that, does it even need to convert SDF video into HDR, you may ask. The answer is yes. Here are some reasons why:</p><ul><li><strong>Dark&#x2F;Light Balance</strong></li></ul><p>HDR content assures more light-and-dark balance in the videos&#x2F;images captured compared to the displayed version. The HDR video files have more defined highlights and shadows and noticeable luminance differences in scenes. So, the imagery is more realistic whether one clicks pictures outdoors or indoors, during the day or night.</p><ul><li><strong>3D Effect</strong></li></ul><p>Videos with a high dynamic range have enhanced depth perception. So, the surface objects are more noticeable, with perceptible shadows under the object against the background. Therefore, the files have a three-dimensional effect after you turn <strong>SDR to HDR.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>A wide color gamut is available</strong></li></ul><p>HDR video comes with the availability of a wider color gamut that is not supported under SDR. With HDR, it is possible to expand the luminance and contrast levels, and color gradients are more prominent. To note, SDR monitors run with the Rec.709 colorspace spectrum, while HDR supports a wider Rec.2020 colorspace with more color variations.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://coinrule.sjv.io/c/5597632/1958378/18409" target="_top" id="1958378">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1958378" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://coinrule.sjv.io/i/5597632/1958378/18409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Method-1-Up-mapping-SDR-Archive-Content-to-HDR"><a href="#Method-1-Up-mapping-SDR-Archive-Content-to-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Up-mapping SDR Archive Content to HDR"></a>Method 1: Up-mapping SDR Archive Content to HDR</h3><p>It is possible to <strong>convert SDR to HDR</strong> after the legacy video-based content is mastered or recorded in SDR quality. Here, one can upconvert the content quality to HDR using the inverse tone mapping procedure. There are three content types that fall under the SDR Archive Content version:</p><ul><li><strong>SDR live-captured video content that comes with uncontrolled lighting</strong>. An example here includes Live Outdoor Sports shooting.</li><li><strong>SDR live-captured video content is available with controlled lighting</strong>. Examples include concerts, studio content recordings, and Indoor Sports shooting.</li><li><strong>Post-produced or mastered SDR content</strong>. These examples are documentaries and movies.</li></ul><p>Two sequences are available for upconverting SDR content from the archive to HDR. A suitable method would be to use the inverse tone-mapping functionality to set the HDR effect on the SDR content.</p><p>This process makes the SDR clips blend smoothly into the HDR content after you remaster them. You can use the real-time inverse tone-mapping tools and converters to make the SDR to HDR conversion.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Up-convert-SDR-clips-to-HDR-with-Video-editing-Software"><a href="#Method-2-Up-convert-SDR-clips-to-HDR-with-Video-editing-Software" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Up-convert SDR clips to HDR with Video-editing Software"></a>Method 2: Up-convert SDR clips to HDR with Video-editing Software</h3><p>One of the best ways to convert SDR to HDR is to use video editing software.
