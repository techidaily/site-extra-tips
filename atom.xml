This is generally because the shaky videography can make it difficult to really follow what is going on, or possibly also because it is hard to watch without feeling ill.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/stabilizer.jpg"                      alt="stabilizer"                ></p><p> This same complaint is often used in iPhone videography – it is difficult to follow because the video is shaking. The shaking is what happens when the video lacks stability – remember that most professional camera work is done with cameras which are on some form of frame or tripod to keep the camera still. It isn’t that an iPhone is heavy – it is more to do with the video being hard to keep still, especially if our attention is distracted. For the best videos, people should invest in some form of tripod for their phone.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1868575/19272" target="_top" id="1868575">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1868575" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1868575/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Use-Light-Properly"><a href="#Use-Light-Properly" class="headerlink" title="Use Light Properly"></a>Use Light Properly</h2><p> Professional video shoots use a lot of light in order to create the proper effect – most people would be surprised to learn how much light goes into even a ‘night-time’ set. Phone videos often suffer a lot because they do not make adequate use of light. Part of this can be solved by taking a camera class which covers light issues, but it can also be solved by paying attention to light sources where you are, and changing them to better suit your video if possible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/set-light-iphone.jpg"                      alt="light"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087267/19272" target="_top" id="2087267">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087267" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2087267/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Avoid-Using-the-Digital-Zoom"><a href="#Avoid-Using-the-Digital-Zoom" class="headerlink" title="Avoid Using the Digital Zoom"></a>Avoid Using the Digital Zoom</h2><p> It can be very tempting to try and use the zoom function on your camera to see people better, but this ultimately doesn’t work. You will end up with a grainy video of uncertain quality, rather than one which allows you to see everything in close up. Just move towards the point you are attempting to film – the quality of the video will be better, and you will not have to fiddle with controls and menus while making the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/Zoom.jpg"                      alt="zoom"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105864/7443" target="_top" id="2105864">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105864" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105864/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Use-the-Grid"><a href="#Use-the-Grid" class="headerlink" title="Use the Grid"></a>Use the Grid</h2><p> Pictures and videos can be taken in either portrait or landscape format, as everybody who has tried to take a picture knows. When recording a video, you should use this to your advantage and try and find which grid would be the most effective for your video. Using the grids is very easy - simply tip the iPhone in the direction you want to film, and the film will automatically work in that format. Since it can be very easy for a phone to change grids while videoing, this is another opportunity for a stabiliser such as a tripod to be put into use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/grid-iphone-camera.png"                      alt="grid"                ></p><h2 id="Use-the-Exposure-Lock"><a href="#Use-the-Exposure-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Use the Exposure Lock"></a>Use the Exposure Lock</h2><p> When taking a video or a picture, you will have noticed that it can change the colour and the exposure while trying to get a lock and fix on what it is going to be recording. While it is good that it tries to find the best way to accommodate the light and sound in the room, having your video change exposure throughout will be at best annoying and at worst an outright distraction. Lock your exposure down on the iPhone once you have found the optimum conditions for the video, and it will not change.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/lock-exposure.jpg"                      alt="exposure"                ></p><h2 id="Use-Slow-Motion-Time-Lapse-Mode"><a href="#Use-Slow-Motion-Time-Lapse-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Use Slow Motion\Time Lapse Mode"></a>Use Slow Motion\Time Lapse Mode</h2><p> One way to make videos more interesting is to use either slow motion or time lapse features. The well-known use of time lapse video is if the video is extremely long, and it needs to be shortened – we are all aware of the use of montages in films, after all – and it can be very effective when used correctly. Slow motion is different - it can be used for the same reasons as in films, but it can also be used for when you need to follow instructions, or for when you want to follow what is being done in absolute detail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/time-lapse-iphone.jpg"                      alt="time lapse"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2037358/7443" target="_top" id="2037358">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2037358" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2037358/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Put-your-iPhone-in-Airplane-Mode"><a href="#Put-your-iPhone-in-Airplane-Mode" class="headerlink" title="Put your iPhone in Airplane Mode"></a>Put your iPhone in Airplane Mode</h2><p> There is nothing worse than being in the middle of recording a great video, and then being interrupted by a notification. Even worse, since phones vibrate when they receive a notification, and it will ruin the entire video if that happens, since the phone will move and throw off the exposure and the light enhancements which you have been using.</p><p> Putting your phone in airplane mode allows you to stop any notifications from coming in at all, and thus keeping them from ruining your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/airplane-mode.jpg"                      alt="airplane mode"                ></p><h2 id="Edit-your-Video-with-Filmora"><a href="#Edit-your-Video-with-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Edit your Video with Filmora"></a>Edit your Video with Filmora</h2><p> Films go through extensive editing processes before being released to the general public, so why shouldn’t you edit your videos? Things go wrong in the process of making a video – somebody appears where they shouldn’t, a phone rings, people have conversations, the tripod falls down, the camera ends up pointed the wrong way….a lot can happen. Editing your video means that you can take all these problems out, and also means that you can tighten up the video generally, improve the sound quality, and make sure that everything is as it should be before you show it off.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://coinrule.sjv.io/c/5597632/1610918/18409" target="_top" id="1610918">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18409-1610918" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://coinrule.sjv.io/i/5597632/1610918/18409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> Using your iPhone to make a video is not something which requires a lot of extra equipment – it simply requires some planning on your part, as well as knowledge of your iPhone’s systems. Being able to control the grid for the videos, the exposure, and anything else which can be controlled through the iPhone systems makes for much better videos off the bat, while adding in video editing software and tripods can improve the experience even more. Videos on an iPhone shouldn’t be seen as impossible.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135353/19272" target="_top" id="2135353">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135353" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135353/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Ollie Mattison</p><p>Ollie Mattison is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Ollie Mattison</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/024-approved-yielding-income-a-streamers-guide-to-earning/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Yielding Income A Streamer's Guide to Earning</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/new-animtech-full-audit-24-summary/"><u>[New] AnimTech Full Audit '24 Summary</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-mastering-snapchats-secret-stories-creation-guide/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Mastering Snapchat's Secret Stories Creation Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-tiktoks-biggest-foodie-trends-unveiled/"><u>[Updated] TikTok's Biggest Foodie Trends Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-vrecorder-ez-instal-your-step-by-step/"><u>[Updated] VRecorder EZ-Instal Your Step-by-Step</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/1722971531592-effortless-setup-get-samsung-c460-driver-installed-today/"><u>Effortless Setup: Get Samsung C460 Driver Installed Today</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/faced-with-facetime-problems-try-these-15-troubleshooting-tips/"><u>Faced With FaceTime Problems?

You might have observed the outstanding service offers by HP models where users can easily control all applications on their device with simple drag, point and swipe like motions on screen surface; as well as you can us mouse and keyboard. Most of the systems these days are designed with capacitive touch system that offers great conductivity for every touch of human finger. The most interesting one is 10 point advanced capacitive touch system that allows users to enjoy multi touch functionality on their device screen.</p><h2 id="Things-to-Consider-When-Buying-4K-All-in-One-Touchscreen-PC"><a href="#Things-to-Consider-When-Buying-4K-All-in-One-Touchscreen-PC" class="headerlink" title="Things to Consider When Buying 4K All-in-One Touchscreen PC"></a>Things to Consider When Buying 4K All-in-One Touchscreen PC</h2><ol><li><strong>Graphics Chip:</strong></li></ol><p> You might have seen that most of desktops usually rely on their integrated graphic design that is added to processors but with the new technologies now gamers can expect much impressive quality with new dedicated graphic controls. You can buy this device in two configurations: 24 inch and classic 27 inch. Generally the 10 series unique “Pascal” graphic chips offer great gaming experience but when we talk about True gaming AIOs then users can expect classic touch screen response for their gaming needs. Buyers are advised to avoid spending on last generation Maxwell unless it sellers offer you great discount.</p><ol><li><strong>Optical Drives &amp; Audio:</strong></li></ol><p> Most of the advanced models of multimedia devices do not have optical drive support; you will find very rare models that allow Blu-ray Discs and DVD playback with built in tray drive. But today you need to use a USB type CD&#x2F;DVD drive to gain control over optical discs. Most of the manufacturers these days offer AIO systems for impressive sound quality but it is good to test one before you buy.</p><ol><li><strong>Core Connectivity:</strong></li></ol><p> When to go to buy a consumer PC then it is good to check for inbuilt WI-FI support with 802.11ac standard. Never forget to check the side mounted ports like USB because they will assist you to make easy connections with external world. The systems with HDMI port must be given higher priority because it assist users to enjoy all in one display performance with gaming consol as well as with cable box.</p><ol><li><strong>Screen Tilt:</strong></li></ol><p> Some of the most widely preferred screen sizes include 27, 24 and 23 inch displays- note that it is measured diagonally. Commonly, most of the consumer systems come with full HD display capability or offer 1080p resolution level. Those who have already worked with HP 150 must be aware about how tiring its vertical display appears when you have to lift your hand again and again to initiate touch controls. When you need to use your device for long hours then it is always better to have a little tilted back screen so that the shallower angle can serve you with better and comfortable controls. It is good to think about AIO’s stand, they offer wide range of motion and some can tilt up to higher angle.</p><h2 id="Top-4-Best-4K-All-in-One-Touch-Screen-Computer"><a href="#Top-4-Best-4K-All-in-One-Touch-Screen-Computer" class="headerlink" title="Top 4 Best 4K All-in-One Touch Screen Computer"></a>Top 4 Best 4K All-in-One Touch Screen Computer</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1934254/19272" target="_top" id="1934254">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1934254" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1934254/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Dell-XPS7760-7000-BLK-PUS-27”-AIO"><a href="#1-Dell-XPS7760-7000-BLK-PUS-27”-AIO" class="headerlink" title="1.

The size of all photos is often reduced in order to make a picture better suited for use on social media. On the other hand, enlarging a photo can be more complicated than it sounds. Increasing the overall number of pixels in a photo can easily cause pixelization, especially if the original photo was in low resolution. Blurriness, JPEG compression artifacts or image noise are also among frequent unwanted side effects of blowing up digital images.</p><p>Choosing the right software can help you avoid the potential dangers of enlarging images, which is the reason why we are going to take you through some of the best online as well as Mac and PC-based image enlargers.</p><p>Learn more details about <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to create Magnifying Effects in Videos &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><hr><h2 id="Enlarging-Photos-Online-Without-Compromising-Quality"><a href="#Enlarging-Photos-Online-Without-Compromising-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Enlarging Photos Online Without Compromising Quality"></a>Enlarging Photos Online Without Compromising Quality</h2><p>The resolution of an image determines how much that image can be enlarged without losing any quality. For instance, if the photo’s resolution is 600x400 pixels, trying to increase it up to 4000x3000 pixels can cause <strong>blurriness or pixelization</strong>. Let’s have a look at some of the best online tools for enlarging low-resolution photos, without compromising their quality.</p><h4 id="1-PhotoEnlarger"><a href="#1-PhotoEnlarger" class="headerlink" title="1.

In order to import a photo, you can click on the Browse icon and navigate to the folder on your computer where the picture is stored or you can simply drag and drop the file to the <strong>Select Image to Enlarge</strong> area of the tool’s page. <strong>The Scale</strong> value is going to be set to <strong>200%</strong> by default, which means that your image is going to be <strong>doubled in size</strong>, and the PhotoEnlarger platform lets make your photo up to <strong>four times larger than the original</strong>. After selecting the Scale value or inserting new values into the <strong>Width and Height boxes</strong> you just have to click on the <strong>Enlarge button</strong> and wait for the picture to be enlarged. The four versions of the picture in different sizes are going to be generated you can crop each of them and download them.</p><h4 id="2-ImageEnlarger"><a href="#2-ImageEnlarger" class="headerlink" title="2.

The former runs on the mobile devices while the later runs with the computers and other gaming devices.

Whereas on the other hand, mobile headsets typically use smartphones for the display as well as processing; and in the absence of a smartphone, they’re nothing but just shells having lenses.</p><p> Tethered headsets designed to be large, they are expensive, and as well as they are also resource-intensive. They also claim more innovative motion-sensing and head-tracking abilities in opposite to mobile headsets. Other than that, not just the larger headsets consist of extensively devoted motion sensors, they also often work in combination with outside cameras to more exactly track the user’s head. Adding to that, they’re also designed to work with bodily controls, starting from keyboards and gamepads to more exclusive possibilities.</p><p> Now if we talk about the mobile headsets, they are small in size and cheap in price as compared to PC VR Headset. The reason is the most of the work is actually done by the smartphone, so the maximum price of mobile headset could be $100. Most of the mobile headsets are grounded on the Google Cardboard prototype, and with the exclusion of a magnetic switch, they do not have any motorized or electric components in the design; they are only screens with the lenses that divide user’s smartphone’s screen absolutely into two when he holds it to his face.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982596">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982596.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982596">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982596.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982596%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982596/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="When-to-Choose-Mobile-Headset-or-a-VR-Headset-Purchasing-Suggestions"><a href="#When-to-Choose-Mobile-Headset-or-a-VR-Headset-Purchasing-Suggestions" class="headerlink" title="When to Choose Mobile Headset or a VR Headset?

It has its particular lenses and also the display but it is also tethered to the LG G5 mobile with the help of a USB cable. You can regulate things also with buttons present on the HMD or as well as by pushing and long-pressing the display of the smartphone. Audio voice can also come from the headphone jack present on the HMD or through the phone’s earphone port. It is still restricted by the smartphone’s dispensation power but by the presence of its personal lenses, it’s considerably well adapted to virtual reality as compared to Google Cardboard.</p><p> One of the other huge results of a tethered smartphone connection is of the 360 VR is very lighter in weight and debatably more contented than rather like the Gear VR, and it permits for adjustment of the optics. Though it may look awkward, it’s actually not considerably different than the 1st Sony Walkman, which also listed a trivial head gadget which is driven by a tethered device.</p><p><img

The file size is unknown until you have the completed produced video. The terms 20MB and 20Mb are not interchangeable.</p><p>The problem is that a 30-second iPhone recording might easily exceed 100MB in size. 1024 MB or less than 20 minutes. What is the length of a video that is 25 megabytes?</p><p>At 30 frames per second, a raw HD video will require 5MBx30 150MB of storage space. Does anyone know how many MB a 30-second VGA video at 30 frames per second would take up on a memory stick?</p><p> For the raw footage, we’ll need roughly 540GB per hour.</p><p>Bits per second (bps) is the unit of measurement for network transmissions. Even if you have a premium Nitro account, you cannot upload long videos larger than 20MB. - 1080p video size: 258 MB</p><p>As a result, 20MBps is 160Mbps. 1024 bytes per kilobyte. I’d have to look into what kind of file that is.</p><p>How long does a 25MB video last? Each uncompressed frame is approximately 5MB in size.</p><p>Once you have the file size, all you have to do is guess how many times it will be seen. The video file size formula can now be used to address how to compute video file size. TVs that stream video.</p><p>A DVD with excellent quality content holds 47 gigabytes, or little more than 2. I’m using a laptop as a projector, but I also need it to connect to a second TV. 8 Mbps Youtube HD 1080p25</p><p>30 frames per second vs 15 fps. Depending on the aforementioned, a 30-second video could be anywhere from 1 to 30 megabytes. The 400 MB video file will download in less than 11 minutes over a. - 25 Mb seconds.</p><p>If the video is only 2 or 3 minutes long, you should be able to compress the file size significantly. That means one frame in a 4K video file with an 8-bit Bit Depth is 84375 MB in size. Alternatively, 20Mbps is 25MBps.</p><p>That is 20 megabits per second. As a result, many people worry if they can transfer large films through Discord without Nitro. The LG smart television turns on for a few seconds before turning off.</p><p>Many of our storage drives are incapable of writing to disk at that speed. Seconds of 20MB video When I try to edit my video in a video editor, it claims that the resolution is not supported. As a result, 1 minute 60 seconds.</p><p>So 70778880 bits &#x3D; 84375 MB (8 x 1024 × 1024 MB).

Finally, we’ll show you how to alter the video bitrate as a bonus and have a longer video. Continue to read!</p><p><strong>What is the bitrate of the video?</strong></p><p>The entire amount of video data transferred in a given period is known as the video bitrate. To put it another way, each video file has its own set of data that must be sent in order to play it on multiple devices. Video bitrate is the pace at which this data is conveyed over a certain time interval. Video bitrate is usually expressed in bits per second (bps). It’s also important to remember that videos with a higher bitrate typically have a greater file size.</p><p><strong>Does higher video bitrate mean better video quality?</strong></p><p>When looking at the same video with the same resolution, a greater bitrate will accommodate higher image quality in the video output. Bitrates are projected to increase when the resolution is increased and more data is handled.</p><p>As a result, while a high video bitrate can give amazing quality, it can also put a lot of load on your hardware, causing stutters.</p><p><strong>How to change the bitrate of a video in Filmora</strong></p><p>Filmora can be used to change the bitrate of video files.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Beginner’s-Blueprint-for-Zoom-Engagements"><a href="#Beginner’s-Blueprint-for-Zoom-Engagements" class="headerlink" title="Beginner’s Blueprint for Zoom Engagements"></a>Beginner’s Blueprint for Zoom Engagements</h2><p>A few weeks ago, I saw an ad for Zoom in the Charles De Gaulle airport in Paris while making a transfer from Lisbon Portugal. The first thing I thought about was how much money Zoom must be making. Even before the pandemic, Zoom was becoming a market leader in a way that GoToMeeting was previously – primarily from their awesome ease of use.</p><p>Heck, “Zoom” has even become a modern verb, as in, “Hey, let’s jump on a Zoom!”</p><p>One of the recent changes with Zoom is that videos being recorded are now announced as such when you come into the room for privacy reasons. It’s good practice to record all your Zoom meetings. I’ve been able to get testimonials from my clients by recording Zooms.</p><p>Video quality is important because you only get one chance. The source you record with cannot be upgraded in terms of quality. So, if your initial recording is poor, you’re going to be stuck with a subpar recording.</p><p>When recording, think about both your video quality, and the other Zoom participants you might want to record.</p><p>We all know and use Zoom, but there are some tricks you can use to make your videos look even better. Here are some simple tips to get a better-quality video recording from Zoom.</p><h2 id="Turn-on-HD"><a href="#Turn-on-HD" class="headerlink" title="Turn on HD"></a>Turn on HD</h2><p>HD video is disabled in Zoom by default. Obviously, HD requires more bandwidth and online space, so it’s easy to see why this is not enabled by default. So if you have not, be sure to enable HD video.</p><p>You can do that under Preferences -&gt; video. There is a button to toggle on HD. Toggle it on.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/turn-on-hd-camera-zoom.jpg"                      alt="turn on hd camera zoom"                ></p><p><strong>Pro Tip</strong>: periodically check that this has not been disabled when you update to new versions of Zoom.</p><h2 id="Touch-up-Your-Appearance"><a href="#Touch-up-Your-Appearance" class="headerlink" title="Touch up Your Appearance"></a>Touch up Your Appearance</h2><p>Next, under “My Video” click “touch up my appearance.” This will add a slider you can adjust to get the best picture quality. You will see your webcam in real time adjust as you toggle and play with these features.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/touch-up-my-appearance-zoom.jpg"                      alt="touch up my appearance zoom"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136548/16384" target="_top" id="2136548">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2136548" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ursime.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136548/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144271/7443" target="_top" id="2144271">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2144271" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144271/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Adjust-for-Low-Light"><a href="#Adjust-for-Low-Light" class="headerlink" title="Adjust for Low Light"></a>Adjust for Low Light</h2><p>Not everyone has a ring light, but nearly every scene could benefit from the low light adjustment. This uses AI technology to boost the light making a better quality recording in the vast majority of situations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/adjust-for-low-light-zoom.jpg"                      alt="adjust for low light zoom"                ></p><p>People tend to underestimate the power of good lighting in improving your video quality. Not only is brighter usually better when it comes to lighting but if you record with better light, it gives you more options for adjusting the video quality later on in post-production.</p><h2 id="Optimize-Video-Quality"><a href="#Optimize-Video-Quality" class="headerlink" title="Optimize Video Quality"></a>Optimize Video Quality</h2><p>Under the advanced settings, there is a toggle called “Optimize video quality with de-noise.” Make sure this is toggled on. This uses AI software-based noise removal to help improve the video quality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/optimize-video-quality-zoom.jpg"                      alt="optimize video quality zoom"                ></p><h2 id="Use-a-USB-mic"><a href="#Use-a-USB-mic" class="headerlink" title="Use a USB mic"></a>Use a USB mic</h2><p>Have you ever seen a video with really poor sound quality? It makes a huge difference in how you judge the quality of that video. So if you have a USB mic, use that instead of the built-in microphone. Viewers will subconsciously judge the quality of the video not only on video quality, but also on sound quality. It makes a massive difference to the final video recording.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/994842/11832" target="_top" id="994842">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-994842" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/994842/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Use-a-Virtual-Background"><a href="#Use-a-Virtual-Background" class="headerlink" title="Use a Virtual Background"></a>Use a Virtual Background</h2><p>A cluttered background is never ideal in videos. That’s why the rage on YouTube is to use a camera (Like the Canon M50 for example) that naturally provides a bokeh effect, which is a gentle blurring of the background.</p><p>The reason this is so critical is it helps the viewer focus on what is important - which is your speaker.</p><p>So Under “Backgrounds &amp; Effects” choose a virtual background, or the “blur” option to help improve your source video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/use-virtual-background-zoom.jpg"                      alt="use virtual background zoom"                ></p><h2 id="Be-aware-of-the-different-views-during-your-meeting"><a href="#Be-aware-of-the-different-views-during-your-meeting" class="headerlink" title="Be aware of the different views during your meeting"></a>Be aware of the different views during your meeting</h2><p>Zoom records with a single video file, unlike other software options such as Ecamm or Skype Call Recorder. This means the recording will be very similar to what you see.</p><p>When you are in a meeting, you can toggle between the Gallery view, which shows everyone in the meeting in tiles, and the Speaker view, which shows the main speaker in a full-screen mode.</p><p>The recording will record exactly what is on the screen, so if you want to get some variety, you can toggle between these two during your recording.</p><p>There is also a “Highlight” feature where you can manually select a participant to be highlighted regardless if they are the active speaker or not.</p><p>Here’s another tip. You can choose to hide the participants who don’t have a video stream by adjusting one of the video settings Check “Hide non-video participants.”</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043638/7443" target="_top" id="2043638">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043638" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043638/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Wipe-your-webcam"><a href="#Wipe-your-webcam" class="headerlink" title="Wipe your webcam"></a>Wipe your webcam</h2><p>Webcams can pick up dust and oil from time to time. So before important recordings (and also because my kids sometimes use my laptop) I usually wipe my webcam with a lint-free microfiber cloth before important Zooms with my colleagues and clients.</p><p>I use the same type of cloth that I use for cleaning my eyeglasses. Keep it simple and clean!</p><h2 id="Upgrade-your-camera"><a href="#Upgrade-your-camera" class="headerlink" title="Upgrade your camera"></a>Upgrade your camera</h2><p>You can add a better webcam or even a mirrorless camera, like the Canon M50 that is popular with YouTubers as a webcam input. Once you have added the camera, you can select which webcam you want to use from the dropdown menu.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2002019/7443" target="_top" id="2002019">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2002019" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2002019/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Organize-your-Zooms"><a href="#Organize-your-Zooms" class="headerlink" title="Organize your Zooms"></a>Organize your Zooms</h2><p>If you do use your Zooms in your video editing, I would recommend renaming the video file or Zoom folder after your meeting. This doesn’t affect the video quality, but it sure allows the experience of video editing to go much smoother when you know exactly which file you are looking for.</p><h2 id="Final-bonus-tip"><a href="#Final-bonus-tip" class="headerlink" title="Final bonus tip"></a>Final bonus tip</h2><p>Remember, bring energy to what you say. Good energy will raise the quality of ANY video recording. It doesn’t matter if you are giving a lecture, teaching on your Zoom, or giving a sales pitch. Energy is what makes video impactful.</p><p>So there you have some of my favorite tips for boosting the quality of your Zoom recordings.

According to most users, the built-in image viewer is not top of the list. As you keep reading, you will discover why Windows 10 Photos is not a good choice.

Although the reasons vary between users, here are the main ones.</p><h4 id="1-It-is-slow"><a href="#1-It-is-slow" class="headerlink" title="1. It is slow"></a><strong>1. It is slow</strong></h4><p>The Photos app is not a fast photo viewer for Windows 10. Regardless of your computer’s specs, it takes approximately similar load times across all machines. Here are some of the reasons for this flaw:</p><ul><li>Photos take between 10 and 20 seconds to load because the program needs to check if you are connected to your One Drive account.</li><li>Accessing the app through your <strong>File Explorer menu</strong> will alsotake you a while, especially if you have other app extensions on the list. For example, if you have Windows 10 Photo viewer and MS Publisher active on the menu, Photo Viewer for Windows 10 takes a backseat.</li></ul><h4 id="2-It-is-bad-at-batch-process"><a href="#2-It-is-bad-at-batch-process" class="headerlink" title="2.

It is bad at batch process</strong></h4><p>For the amateur photographers reading this, photo batch processing is when you edit multiple pictures simultaneously. For example, image viewer Windows 10 lets you download multiple images with a single click.</p><p>However, that is about as much you can get when using the program compared to the dozens of photo enhancements you can do with other similar software.??</p><h4 id="3-Program-crash-galore"><a href="#3-Program-crash-galore" class="headerlink" title="3.

The application crashes nearly every step of the photo viewing process. For example, it is common for your photo to freeze when saving your edits. As such, you have to restart the program and redo the adjustments.</p><h4 id="4-Horrible-user-experience"><a href="#4-Horrible-user-experience" class="headerlink" title="4.

Here are some of the reasons for this flaw:</p><ul><li>Photos take between 10 and 20 seconds to load because the program needs to check if you are connected to your One Drive account.</li><li>Accessing the app through your <strong>File Explorer menu</strong> will alsotake you a while, especially if you have other app extensions on the list.

If we talk about the fine details then its colour information is stunning enough while native 4K disc edge offers fast Amazon and Netflix connectivity. The 4K HDR ability re-writes the AV setup options so one cannot use traditional test patterns for its image balancing while viewing HDR content. The best trick is to navigate as per player modes as it consists of a coupled HDR input mode that ensures perfect integrity of HDR signal.</p><p> There are numbers of picture modes within tools menu as like User, Movie, Standard and Dynamic. Most of the users may think about Movie mode as their first preference for quality results but the tests show that lots of important audio information is lost during this mode. In case of standard settings, you will be able to avail better subtitle detailing however, contrast and brightness options are equally good in Movie mode. In simple words, selection of right mode highly depends upon user needs and options to make compromises.</p><p> Now, here is one important thing to note that if you try to watch standard blu-ray content with same HDMI input and same content settings then image will naturally get degraded. This happens due to unwanted scaling of image. The best way to get your desired output level is to make adjustments for user settings of this player. It will help you to develop better results for 1080p Blu-ray content but note that switching between viewing modes like this will become complicated if you are not able to remember right disc formats.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/k8500-3.jpg"                      alt=" "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1938721/19272" target="_top" id="1938721">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1938721" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1938721/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Verdict"><a href="#Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Verdict"></a>Verdict</h2><p> In simple words, Samsung UBD-K8500 is one of the best devices for your Ultra HD TV needs.

How to live stream with Online OneStream"></a>Part 3. How to live stream with Online OneStream</h2><p>Live streaming with OneStream is pretty straightforward. I will walk you through a series of steps you can follow to live stream using OneStream successfully.</p><p>Step1 First, head to <a class="link"   href="https://app.onestream.live/signup" >OneStream live website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and create an account. Just input a username, password, and email address. After that, you need to choose a plan. OneStream offers 4 plans, as I have mentioned above. Just go through the plan features and choose the one that best suits you.</p><p>Step2 After you have successfully picked a plan, on the dashboard, you will see 40 top social platforms, and you will be requested to add your social accounts. If you can’t see the social platform you want to live stream to, you can use custom RTMP to stream it. Except for Instagram, you can connect all of your social accounts directly.</p><p>To connect your Instagram account, you must utilize a third-party software called Instafeed. Instead, it will construct your Instagram account’s Sync URL. Once the URL is generated, please copy and paste it into the OneStream Sync URL section. It will successfully connect your Instagram account to OneStream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/live-stream-with-onestream-1.jpg"                      alt="connect onstream to your social accounts"                ></p><p>Step3 To schedule your live stream on the dashboard, click the “three-line” button. You will see the schedule button there in the interface. Click it, and a window will appear. You can set the time zone, time, and date you want your stream to go live.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/live-stream-with-onestream-2.jpg"                      alt="schedule your live stream"                ></p><p>Step4 To go live, click on the “new stream” button at the top of your dashboard. You can choose to go live with a recorded video on your device or cloud storage next. Oro select videos from previous video uploads. Click on “Third-party RTMP source” if you want to use OBS, Zoom, etc., to stream via OneStream.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/live-stream-with-onestream-3.jpg"                      alt="go live and upload your recorded video"                ></p><p>Step5 To see how your live streams are doing, click the “three-line” button on your dashboard and the “Streaming Analytics” tab.

This is an essential part of a game.</p><p> New way of detecting a person’s presence in a game is bio-sensing. These are small sensors which are attached to a data glove, suit or even the body and record movements made by that person in a 3D space. These movements are interpreted by a computer and trigger a variety of responses within that space. These movements are fed back to a computer which then analyses the data and uses it to transform your actions into the appropriate responses on the screen. It was 20 years ago that consumer-level virtual reality last looked likely to touch down, and if you got burned by Nintendo’s ill-fated Virtual Boy or dropped a bundle on theVFX1 Headgear, then you’re likely to be looking at the new crop of virtual reality entertainment technology with some skepticism.</p><h3 id="Virtual-Museums"><a href="#Virtual-Museums" class="headerlink" title="Virtual Museums"></a>Virtual Museums</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/virtual-museums.jpg"                      alt="virtual-museums"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997695/19272" target="_top" id="1997695">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997695" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997695/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Use of virtual reality in museum and historical settings e.g. visitor centers, interactive exhibitions. Interactive displays form a large part of many exhibitions and particularly appeal to children. Children are often difficult to attract at a museum or gallery, as they tend to see this as a boring experience. But the use of interactive technologies such as virtual reality entertainment has changed that perception and opened up these spaces to a new audience. This is a useful way of changing attitudes towards heritage sites such as museums and to encourage more people to visit and take part.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2080328/19272" target="_top" id="2080328">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2080328" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2080328/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Galleries"><a href="#Galleries" class="headerlink" title="Galleries"></a>Galleries</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/virtual-galleries.png"                      alt="virtual-galleries"                ></p><p> Immersive 3-D experience allows students to manipulate virtual objects and experience whatever they’re studying firsthand. Everything started with the pencil that was used to write the books. Then teachers started using the blackboard to improve the efficiency of class. Finally, we now have the abilities to answer any questions we have through the device that is in our pocket. The smartphones, tablets, laptops etc are used by universities to help students access their courses online at anytime.</p><h3 id="Theatre"><a href="#Theatre" class="headerlink" title="Theatre"></a>Theatre</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/virtual-theatre.jpg"                      alt="virtual-theatre"                ></p><p> Three recent productions are described which aimed to use virtual reality technologies not to stimulate reality but to achieve engagement of the audience. This is described as immersing the participant through engaging story telling. The three plays were The Adding Machine, Wings, and Tesla Electric, and they have provided a wealth of information on the art and practice of immersing a theater audience within a fictional world.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/c/5597632/1576474/17382" target="_top" id="1576474">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17382-1576474" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/i/5597632/1576474/17382"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Virtual-theme-parks"><a href="#Virtual-theme-parks" class="headerlink" title="Virtual theme parks"></a>Virtual theme parks</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/virtual-theme-parks.jpg"                      alt="virtual-theme-parks"                ></p><p> Get ready with goggles in theme parks. Virtual reality entertainment, with its computer generated sights and sounds that surround users, soon will transport park goers to places impossible to build. Virtual reality can create spaces that are too elaborate or fantastical to construct in real life and are scary and perilous. It also gives you characters that really are supernatural and paranormal, which sometimes we can’t physically do.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049391/7443" target="_top" id="2049391">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049391" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049391/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Music-VR-experience"><a href="#Music-VR-experience" class="headerlink" title="Music VR experience"></a>Music VR experience</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/music-vr-experience.jpg"                      alt="music-vr-experience"                ></p><p> Music is a game changer.

It uses a host of technologies to achieve this goal and is a technically complex feat that has to account for our perception and cognition. We can expect to see many more innovative uses for the technology in the future and perhaps a fundamental way in which we communicate and work, thanks to the possibilities of virtual reality.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136613/26400" target="_top" id="2136613">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136613" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136613/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Future-of-Virtual-Reality-entertainment"><a href="#Future-of-Virtual-Reality-entertainment" class="headerlink" title="Future of Virtual Reality entertainment"></a>Future of Virtual Reality entertainment</h2><p> It allows the person to view three-dimensional images and these images appear life-sized to the person.
