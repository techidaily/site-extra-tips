Most video editors apply video effects to their artwork for different purposes. Nowadays, videos without effects will probably cause a decrease in audience and supporters. To prevent that, editors keep seeking the best video effects for their videos.</p><p>There are many sources of video effects. Some are included in the video editing software, and you can find some on the internet. There are also video effects that can give a more realistic effect, which is probably a premium one, and you need to spend money to get that video effect in your hands. But if you don’t want to spend money seeking video effects, this article will significantly help you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/free-video-effects.jpg"                      alt="free video effects"                ></p><p>This composition will give you some information on how you will be able to download video effects without spending money.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">How does VFX differ from SFX?</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">When to use SFX</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">When to use VFX</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">How to Get Free Video Effects?</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Pixabay.com</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-2">Pexels.com</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-3">Mixkit.co</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-4">Videezy.com</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-5">Videvo.net</a></li></ol><h2 id="What-are-Video-Effects"><a href="#What-are-Video-Effects" class="headerlink" title="What are Video Effects?"></a>What are Video Effects?</h2><p>The acronym VFX stands for video effects. The term “visual effects,” also known as “VFX,” refers to all types of digitally enhanced pictures, from adding backdrops using greenscreen to incorporating GGI models and entities. In filmmaking and video production, visual effects refer to how imagery is created or altered outside of a live-action shot.</p><h3 id="How-does-VFX-differ-from-SFX"><a href="#How-does-VFX-differ-from-SFX" class="headerlink" title="How does VFX differ from SFX?"></a>How does VFX differ from SFX?</h3><p>These concepts are frequently ambiguous; therefore, we wanted to examine this subject in greater detail to clarify any misunderstandings.</p><p>Usually, you can infer from the context which “kind” of VFX is being discussed. When debates about when to employ one method over another or whether to use both ways to accomplish an effect in a shot emerge, SFX and VFX are frequently used jointly in a production.</p><p>Both SFX and VFX are tools that let you strengthen your story’s narrative. Your production will probably require either or both of the solutions mentioned earlier. How, though, can you tell which is best for your project?</p><h3 id="When-to-use-SFX"><a href="#When-to-use-SFX" class="headerlink" title="When to use SFX"></a>When to use SFX</h3><p>Special effects transport viewers to a simpler era of movie and television production. SFX was used—and is frequently still used—to improve a scene or set piece. Things that might occur haphazardly in real life but need careful planning on the set include an explosion, fire, or a rainy day in a love story. On-set special effects are frequently used to generate snow, rain or to add smoke to a scene. The addition of fire, either to decorate sets or to be employed in a stunt involving people, is another component of the SFX skill set.</p><h3 id="When-to-use-VFX"><a href="#When-to-use-VFX" class="headerlink" title="When to use VFX"></a>When to use VFX</h3><p>Then why would you need to use digitally created snow, fire, rain, or other effects as VFX if SFX recorded on camera are so effective?</p><p>It might be one scenario if you had a larger canvas to fill and more images to take. Using VFX to produce a snowy landscape with expansive views will be simpler and less expensive. The same holds with rain.</p><p>Then it would be best if you contemplate the circumstances that exist on-set. If you add smoke to a scene to help it come to life—say, a fight scene in a historical drama—the wind may blow it away, or it might not “behave” the way you want it to. You will then require VFX smoke. On-set SFX cannot be “ordered” to act in a manner that the director, production crew, or writers deem appropriate for the plot.</p><p>Another problem is that artificial snow and set smoke can occasionally make actors unresponsive. Snow machines aren’t always suited for every situation because they may also be pretty noisy.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2130887/7443" target="_top" id="2130887">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2130887" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2130887/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="How-to-Get-Free-Video-Effects"><a href="#How-to-Get-Free-Video-Effects" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Free Video Effects?"></a>How to Get Free Video Effects?</h2><p>Video effects are primarily included in your downloaded video editing software. But if you just downloaded a free video editing software, the video effects included are usually limited and sometimes superficial. Many video editing software offers premium video effects, which is undoubtedly not disappointing, but you have to spend money for a subscription to unlock all the features of that software.</p><p>This composition will show you how to get free video effects from different websites. Remember that it is free, so you should not expect more because, you know, the cooler and more realistic the video effect, the greater its value.</p><h3 id="1-Pixabay-com"><a href="#1-Pixabay-com" class="headerlink" title="1.

The term “visual effects,” also known as “VFX,” refers to all types of digitally enhanced pictures, from adding backdrops using greenscreen to incorporating GGI models and entities. In filmmaking and video production, visual effects refer to how imagery is created or altered outside of a live-action shot.</p><h3 id="How-does-VFX-differ-from-SFX-1"><a href="#How-does-VFX-differ-from-SFX-1" class="headerlink" title="How does VFX differ from SFX?"></a>How does VFX differ from SFX?</h3><p>These concepts are frequently ambiguous; therefore, we wanted to examine this subject in greater detail to clarify any misunderstandings.</p><p>Usually, you can infer from the context which “kind” of VFX is being discussed. When debates about when to employ one method over another or whether to use both ways to accomplish an effect in a shot emerge, SFX and VFX are frequently used jointly in a production.</p><p>Both SFX and VFX are tools that let you strengthen your story’s narrative. Your production will probably require either or both of the solutions mentioned earlier. How, though, can you tell which is best for your project?</p><h3 id="When-to-use-SFX-1"><a href="#When-to-use-SFX-1" class="headerlink" title="When to use SFX"></a>When to use SFX</h3><p>Special effects transport viewers to a simpler era of movie and television production. SFX was used—and is frequently still used—to improve a scene or set piece. Things that might occur haphazardly in real life but need careful planning on the set include an explosion, fire, or a rainy day in a love story. On-set special effects are frequently used to generate snow, rain or to add smoke to a scene. The addition of fire, either to decorate sets or to be employed in a stunt involving people, is another component of the SFX skill set.</p><h3 id="When-to-use-VFX-1"><a href="#When-to-use-VFX-1" class="headerlink" title="When to use VFX"></a>When to use VFX</h3><p>Then why would you need to use digitally created snow, fire, rain, or other effects as VFX if SFX recorded on camera are so effective?</p><p>It might be one scenario if you had a larger canvas to fill and more images to take. Using VFX to produce a snowy landscape with expansive views will be simpler and less expensive. The same holds with rain.</p><p>Then it would be best if you contemplate the circumstances that exist on-set. If you add smoke to a scene to help it come to life—say, a fight scene in a historical drama—the wind may blow it away, or it might not “behave” the way you want it to. You will then require VFX smoke. On-set SFX cannot be “ordered” to act in a manner that the director, production crew, or writers deem appropriate for the plot.</p><p>Another problem is that artificial snow and set smoke can occasionally make actors unresponsive. Snow machines aren’t always suited for every situation because they may also be pretty noisy.</p><h2 id="How-to-Get-Free-Video-Effects-1"><a href="#How-to-Get-Free-Video-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Free Video Effects?"></a>How to Get Free Video Effects?</h2><p>Video effects are primarily included in your downloaded video editing software. But if you just downloaded a free video editing software, the video effects included are usually limited and sometimes superficial. Many video editing software offers premium video effects, which is undoubtedly not disappointing, but you have to spend money for a subscription to unlock all the features of that software.</p><p>This composition will show you how to get free video effects from different websites. Remember that it is free, so you should not expect more because, you know, the cooler and more realistic the video effect, the greater its value.</p><h3 id="1-Pixabay-com-1"><a href="#1-Pixabay-com-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

The Rift had it’s unveiling on 28th March 2016. Its price is currently $599 and comes with an Xbox controller.</p><p>The requirements for The Rift are:</p><ul><li>NVIDIA GTX 970 equivalent or greater</li><li>AMD 290 equivalent or greater</li><li>Intel i5-4590 equivalent or greater</li><li>8GB+ DDR3 RAM</li><li>HDMI 1.3 video output</li><li>2 USB 3.0 ports</li></ul><p>Accessories:</p><ul><li>Remote</li><li>Xbox One Controller</li></ul><p>Specs:</p><ul><li>1080 × 1200 per eye and two screen resolution 2160 × 1200 pixels</li><li>100-110 degree field of view</li><li>3D Audio</li><li>Gyroscope Magnetometer Tracking Sensor Array</li><li>Weight 470 g (1.03 lbs.)</li><li>USB, HDMI</li></ul><p>The Rift allows players to feel virtual reality from the ease of a chair. Oculus Touch controllers will ultimately take VR to another dimension. The Rift is enclosed in a black fabric that gives off a premium feel and gives it a distinction from other VR Headsets. It is lightweight and its straps are designed so that they adjust easily. All the cords are boarded on one side. For glasses-wearers, this is going to be a difficult fit and will take some tricks before it fits.</p><p>Rift’s screen resolution is 2160 x 1200 and OLED display has been used, these are a lot of pixels per eye; this means you’ll be getting a ultra-quality view to the eyes with a 90 Hz refresh rate.</p><p>The Rift has to render objects in the stereotypical way, which means it has to keep track of the pictures, the head movements and head’s positions at various times in the physical space.</p><p>Oculus Rift has the most solid lineup of games putting it on the advantage. It has access to both Steam VR and Oculus Store giving the users a surplus amount of games already.</p><p>Although the Rift demands a hardcore gaming desktop, its price is still at a medium range. It also gives the ability to perform in a small room which is an excellent feature. But the drawback is that it only works on head movement and it has some heat up problems. There are no motion controllers at the moment.</p><h3 id="PlayStation-VR"><a href="#PlayStation-VR" class="headerlink" title="PlayStation VR"></a>PlayStation VR</h3><p>The PlayStation VR is yet to be revealed but its unveiled price shows that it is the best priced VR Headset i.e. $399 excluding a $60 PS Camera which is a requirement. The PS VR will be launching on 13th October 2016.</p><p>As far as the requirements are concerned, this VR Headset only requires a Sony PlayStation 4.</p><p>Accessories:</p><ul><li>PS Move</li><li>DualShock</li></ul><p>Specs:</p><ul><li>1920 × 1080 single screen, 960 × 1080 per eye</li><li>100 degree field of view</li><li>120 Hz refresh Rate</li><li>3D Audio</li><li>Gyroscope Magnetometer, PS Eye Tracking, Accelerometer</li><li>Weight 610 g (1.34 lbs.)</li></ul><p>Sony has taken a completely diverse approach to the design of its headset. It resembles a Sci-Fi kind of technology like that in Star Trek. It has a helmet like portion above its goggles with can be adjusted to fit on different sized heads. This means that you won’t feel you’re wearing some funny goggles; instead, you get the feel of a super-cool helmet. The weight is balanced such that your eyes and nose do not feel the entire weight of the thing.</p><p>PlayStation VR consists of a 1920 x 1080 display (5.7-inch). An OLED display split delivers a resolution of 960 x 1080 the user’s respective eyes vertically. Sony was found to underperform in picture sharpness but this headset has got its advantage in the stunning 120 Hz refresh rate, which takes it to the top in this matter.</p><p>The tracking mechanism is similar to that of Rift’s but PS VR has got its advantage because of its powerful AMD processor and a lot of sensors which track every movement and put the amazing feeling in the virtual reality with matchless synchronization.</p><p>The drawback of PlayStation VR is that it is only designed for PS4. Good news is, each and every game of PS4 is supported. But this puts The Rift one step ahead.</p><p>In terms of price, conform, sensors and their amazing VR effect and its extreme refresh rate, this VR Headset comes on top; what lags it behind is its heavy duty weight, low resolution and its inability to perform with PCs.</p><h3 id="HTC-Vive"><a href="#HTC-Vive" class="headerlink" title="HTC Vive"></a>HTC Vive</h3><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Vive VR <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the priciest VR Headset; $799. It was released on 5th April 2016.</p><p>System Requirements:</p><ul><li>NVIDIA GTX 970 equivalent or greater</li><li>AMD 290 equivalent or greater</li><li>Intel i5-4590 equivalent or greater</li><li>AMD FZ 8350 equivalent or greater</li><li>8GB+ DDR3 RAM</li><li>HDMI 1.4 video output</li><li>1 USB 2.0 port or greater</li></ul><p>Accessories:</p><ul><li>2 wireless controllers</li></ul><p>Specs:</p><ul><li>1080 × 1200 per eye; two screen resolution of 2160 × 1200</li><li>110 degree field of view</li><li>90Hz refresh rate</li><li>Front facing Gyroscope Camera, laser sensor</li><li>Weight 555 g (1.22 lbs.)</li></ul><p>As far as design is concerned, you will not look cool wearing these huge amusing goggles on your face. The Vive gives a dimpled look and has an elastic to support it on your head. Very discomforting indeed. But it comes with a perk, that is, HTC added an external camera on the front so that the user is able to look on the other side.</p><p>Vive VR and the Rift have the same resolution, giving a 1080 x 1200 image for each eye that combines to become a 2160 x 1200 resolution. Both have a refresh rate of 90 Hz and a 110-degree field of view. This puts the Rift ahead since it’s much cheaper.</p><p>In terms of games, the Vive VR kind of ties with Sony since HTC has not provided many games from other platforms; only PC games can be played.</p><p>The reason for such a costly hardware is the superior Incomparable VR experience, room-scale tracking, and intuitive interface.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a

href="#Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Verdict"></a>Verdict</h2><p>The HTC Vive is very costly yet it does not provide sufficient features with such a great price. Hence the Vive has been lagging behind and discussed less in websites. However, the competition is more challenging between Sony and The Rift; Sony gives superior feel and comfort as well as an unmatched tracking and refresh rate. But the Rift has a bigger hand in image quality and weight. Right now it would be fair to put The Vive on top since the PlayStation VR is yet to be released and has not been tested and rated by users yet.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134224/18498" target="_top" id="2134224">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134224" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134224/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/new-advanced-techniques-for-proximity-viewing-in-roblox/"><u>[New] Advanced Techniques for Proximity Viewing in Roblox</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-high-definition-video-refiner-for-pcmacos/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved High Definition Video Refiner for PC/MacOS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/updated-best-practices-for-identifying-premier-free-srt-translation-services/"><u>[Updated] Best Practices for Identifying Premier Free SRT Translation Services</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/updated-cinematic-craftsman-corner-qanda-hub/"><u>[Updated] Cinematic Craftsman Corner Q&A Hub</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-exclusive-insiders-pick-best-open-world-games/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Exclusive Insider's Pick Best Open World Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-mastering-the-nuances-of-softening-sounds-via-lumafusion/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Mastering the Nuances of Softening Sounds via Lumafusion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-tips.techidaily.com/cutting-edge-free-premiere-pro-templates-2023/"><u>Cutting-Edge, FREE Premiere Pro Templates 2023</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/from-picture-to-paragraph-text-on-windows-and-mac-photos/"><u>From Picture to Paragraph Text on Windows & Mac Photos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlocking-potential-with-nikon-written-by-emily-roberts-on-june-4-2023/"><u>In 2024, Unlocking Potential with Nikon' Written by Emily Roberts on June 4, 2023</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/larger-pictures-same-sharpness-levels/"><u>Larger Pictures, Same Sharpness Levels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-split-trim-and-perfect-video-editing-techniques-in-windows-live-movie-maker/"><u>New 2024 Approved Split, Trim, and Perfect Video Editing Techniques in Windows Live Movie Maker</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-answers.techidaily.com/solution-guide-why-minecraft-says-unable-to-connect-and-what-to-do-about-it/"><u>Solution Guide: Why Minecraft Says 'Unable to Connect' And What to Do About It</u></a></li><li><a href="https://common-error.techidaily.com/step-by-step-guide-resolving-windows-videodxgkrnlcrash-issue/"><u>Step-by-Step Guide: Resolving Windows Video_Dxgkrnl_Crash Issue</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

However, while these may work at first, twice, or even three times, they rarely produce long-term results.</p><p>Incorporating such <strong>storytelling in marketing</strong> captures attention, entices, and encourages potential customers — everything we need to close a sale. In addition, it encourages intimacy and trust — all of the additives for a fulfilling relationship.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/best-storytelling-in-marketing-sale-conversation.jpg"                      alt="best of storytelling in marketing sale conversation"                ></p><h2 id="What-is-Storytelling"><a href="#What-is-Storytelling" class="headerlink" title="What is Storytelling?"></a>What is Storytelling?</h2><p>Storytelling is an ancient form of interactive personal expression that expresses the narrative while revealing many images and circumstances to the listener. Stories have always facilitated communication. A good story can also be told effectively using photos, images, and movies.</p><p>In line with this, storytelling also seeks to convey an idea by igniting the audience’s imagination through the storyteller’s words to create an image. Using storytelling, you may even write your own digital story. Therefore, inspiring stories serve as motivators and positively impact individuals’ behavior. The skill and influence of emotional storytelling can alter people’s attitudes, instill loyalty, and inspire them to perform specific actions.</p><h2 id="Why-is-Content-Marketing-so-Important"><a href="#Why-is-Content-Marketing-so-Important" class="headerlink" title="Why is Content Marketing so Important?"></a>Why is Content Marketing so Important?</h2><p>Content marketing improves the company’s online reputation. Viewers are served a variety of content in the form of blog entries, videos, infographics, presentations, and social media posts. By providing value, you draw in the audience while establishing brand trust.</p><p>Below are some reasons why successful content marketing storytelling can increase your company’s success.</p><p><strong>1. Develops a powerful brand personality</strong></p><p>Every brand has specific principles and traits that customers connect with, whether you attempt to or not. A brand personality relates to “who” a consumer is speaking with; as a result, a firm must be genuine, incorporate their worldviews, and explain why it matters in the context of their personal story. Storytelling marketing encourages your clients to feel a part of something bigger.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/brand-personality-storytelling-marketing-digital.jpg"                      alt="brand personality in storytelling marketing digital"                ></p><p>The company’s story will be distinctive and interesting to the community if you take risky positions and emphasize your company principles. A memorable marketing narrative can make you stand out in a particular field, making you seem more like a friend than a faceless corporation.</p><p><strong>2. Builds an emotional connection and loyalty with customers</strong></p><p>People can identify with and interact with the finest tales because they feel something; as a result, they invest in the brand and what it advocates. The audience is likelier to like you and your business if they can relate to you or comprehend the steps that went into developing the brand.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/content-marketing-storytelling-customer-connection.jpg"                      alt="customer connection in content marketing storytelling"                ></p><p>The ability to create emotions through the narrative is a significant weapon since it is kept in mind that people rarely make reasonable judgments. To effectively express your goal, transform it into an engaging story and employ a real storytelling and marketing approach.</p><p><strong>3. Generating new leads</strong></p><p>Lead generation is essential for small businesses because they depend on steady traffic to develop their brand and increase revenue. In addition to being excellent for generating leads, content marketing is also reasonably priced. If your business is working toward objective clients can support, you have a significantly higher chance of success.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/storytelling-and-marketing-generate-new-leads.jpg"                      alt="storytelling and marketing generates new leads"                ></p><p>People prefer to make purchases from organizations they perceive to be sympathetic. It’s simple to see content marketing storytelling’s importance when considering the return on investment. Emotional storytelling reveals your company’s empathy, which will most likely contribute to commercial success.</p><h2 id="How-to-Become-a-Good-Storyteller-for-Marketing"><a href="#How-to-Become-a-Good-Storyteller-for-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="How to Become a Good Storyteller for Marketing?"></a>How to Become a Good Storyteller for Marketing?</h2><p>A great storyteller can make a good narrative even more powerful. Therefore, skilled storytellers can captivate their audience, guide them in the right direction, and leave readers or listeners with new information to assimilate and a lesson they may keep for the rest of their existence.</p><p>The techniques listed below will help you become a better storyteller for marketing.</p><p><strong>1. Pick a compelling main point</strong></p><p>The main moral or message of a great story usually develops throughout. When writing a story, you must know what you are aiming to have. No matter what story you want to tell, it’s important to be certain about the central idea or conceit around which it is built.</p><p><strong>2. Have a clear plot structure</strong></p><p>The story’s narrative acts as its main direction. It ensures the story has a beginning, middle, and end and all the enjoyable material; thus, it creates a comfortable environment for your audience and lets people concentrate on other elements of your marketing narrative. A satisfying conclusion will also give your audience a sense of closure. Only if you are positioning yourself for the following chapter is it permissible to leave your character holding to the cliff’s brink.</p><p><strong>3. Show empathy</strong></p><p>Highly empathic individuals who focus on what other people think and feel are excellent storytellers. When telling stories, using empathy can assist you in choosing the most powerful terminology to describe a perspective that focuses on how you believe your use of language would affect an audience.</p><p><strong>4. Make it your own</strong></p><p>Consider providing a personal touch when delivering a narrative, whether it is to entertain or market a product. Your pitch will have the “genuine” factor with a personal touch. It is communicated through a testimonial. If you’re writing a story to entertain the audience, use your personal experiences to enrich the marketing narrative. This tip will give your story a more genuine sense.</p><p><strong>5. Feature appealing characters</strong></p><p>The character must be endearing if you desire your audience to root to see them succeed. Let your audience witness the development of emotions that your character experiences. Nothing is more depressing than a motionless character. Show them whoever your character is rather than telling them.</p><p><strong>6. Engage your audience</strong></p><p>A key component of effective visual storytelling marketing is engaging your audience, but how you do so largely relies on the type of storytelling marketing you’re doing. Consider your audience whenever you decide how to tell your narrative.</p><h2 id="How-can-Storytelling-in-Marketing-be-Presented-Finally"><a href="#How-can-Storytelling-in-Marketing-be-Presented-Finally" class="headerlink" title="How can Storytelling in Marketing be Presented Finally?"></a>How can Storytelling in Marketing be Presented Finally?</h2><p><strong>1. Text</strong></p><p>Written stories mostly consist of text, though they may also include pertinent imagery. Since this kind of story only needs paper and a pen or even some free writing software like Google Docs, it is also the most accessible and the simplest to write. A blog entry, an essay, and sometimes even a book are effective ways for a written story to reach its intended audience.</p><p>The best example of this type is the “socially aware, designer eyewear at revolutionary pricing” story from <a class="link"   href="https://www.warbyparker.com/history" >Warby Parker. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Instead of merely declaring things are cheap, they provide more context for the assertion by telling a story that explains why they are. He goes so far as to write stories explaining his beginnings on their cleaning cloths, adding a personalized experience and making it more efficient in storytelling and marketing.</p><p><strong>2. Audio</strong></p><p>These stories are very similar to textual stories, except that they are recorded. Technology breakthroughs have made it more accessible than ever to produce audio stories. Podcasts are typically used to tell such a marketing narrative. Great podcasters can blend emotional storytelling into their podcasts to make them entertaining and digestible while inspiring people to act.</p><p>This kind of podcast is exemplified by Camela Thompson from <a class="link"   href="https://calibermind.com/thought-leadership/podcasts/" >CaliberMind’s The Revenue Marketing Report. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Additionally, it is a podcast that primarily serves as a tool for education. On the show’s blogs, the features of each episode are presented, and on the website, you can arrange the episodes by genre.</p><p><strong>3. Photo</strong></p><p>A portion of photographic storytelling includes taking pictures of intriguing situations and events that are difficult to describe in words. These images either convey the tale of a fascinating person or people in an underappreciated setting or take on civil liberties or awareness aspects by highlighting the suffering of those living in impoverished or conflict-torn areas.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Javier-Arcenillas-5e418762e61ba-jpeg%5F%5F880.jpg" >“Latinoamerica,” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> a long-term piece by Javier Arcenilla, is an illustration of this kind. The photographer set out to capture the core of unchecked brutality in Latin America, the political and social forces that tenaciously support it, and the will to stop it. It is regarded as one of the best examples of how photography is used in storytelling in marketing.</p><p><strong>4. Video</strong></p><p>The best tools for collecting and sharing emotions are digital stories. Videos are used to narrate these stories. They cost the most to make, considering that they are the most advanced.</p><p>Fortunately, inexpensive video editing software may give your video story a polished, expert appearance without costing a fortune. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a fantastic video editor for creating content marketing storytelling because it has a handy timeline, the option to merge and edit audio and video recordings separately, powerful effects, and the opportunity to customize the interface.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2098702/14409" target="_top" id="2098702">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2098702" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2098702/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong><em>Note: For further details, go to <a class="link"   href="https://youtu.be/u2i39suoH5c" >Wondershare Filmora 11 | More Than Just You. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em></strong></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135360/19272" target="_top" id="2135360">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135360" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135360/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Start-Your-Marketing-Storytelling-Tour"><a href="#Start-Your-Marketing-Storytelling-Tour" class="headerlink" title="Start Your Marketing Storytelling Tour"></a>Start Your Marketing Storytelling Tour</h2><p>Content marketing and storytelling go seamlessly together.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Quick-Windows-Surfing-Guide-Unveiled"><a href="#Quick-Windows-Surfing-Guide-Unveiled" class="headerlink" title="Quick Windows Surfing Guide Unveiled"></a>Quick Windows Surfing Guide Unveiled</h2><p>Windows operating system comes with an inbuilt file preview feature embedded in Explorer. This feature lets you preview documents and images before uploading them on apps like Skype, Facebook, and more. But what happens if you want to preview videos, audio, spreadsheets, ZIP, and more? In that case, install <strong>QuickLook for Windows</strong>. So, what exactly is <strong>QuickLook for Windows 10,</strong> and where can you get this app? For answers and more, read to the end.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Download-Quick-Look-App-on-Microsoft-Store"><a href="#Part-1-Download-Quick-Look-App-on-Microsoft-Store" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Download Quick Look App on Microsoft Store"></a>Part 1: Download Quick Look App on Microsoft Store</h2><p>If your computer is always handling documents, spreadsheets, PDFs, presentations, images, and other files, it’s probably time to install <strong>QuickLook for Mac</strong> and Windows. This intelligent program lets you quickly preview files without opening them on separate apps. Just think of it as the “file viewer” feature on Windows File Explorer, which allows you to view files before loading online or opening them on local apps. Of course, this can help you know which app can open the file and if it’s the correct file to open.</p><p>But although the inbuilt file viewer is excellent to use, it has limited capabilities. For example, you cannot preview zipped files. Also, this inbuilt function cannot preview media files like audio and video. For this reason, install QuickLook for Windows and preview everything on your PC. And by the way, it’s absolutely free to use and comes bundled with a media player to open compatible video and audio formats.</p><p>Below is how to install and use QuickLook by Paddy Xu:</p><p>Step1 Open Microsoft Store and search for QuickLook. Make sure you select the option published by Paddy Xu.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/quicklook-for-windows-1.jpg"                      alt="search for quicklook for windows on Microsoft store"                ></p><p>Step2 Once you find QuickLook, click “Get it” to download and install the app in your Windows operating system. At around 60MB, installing this preview app should be quick and easy.</p><p>Step3 After successfully installing QuickLook, head to File Explorer and select any file you want to preview. Press the “Space” bar on your keyboard to view the file.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/quicklook-for-windows-2.jpg"                      alt="preview video on quicklook for windows"                ></p><p>Unfortunately, you won’t preview the content inside the document file. Instead, you’ll only see details like the file type&#x2F;format, size, image name, and more. You can also directly choose the opening app. As for videos and audio, the media file will automatically play on the QuickLook media player. But don’t fret because the following section will teach you to read your documents, presentations, PDFs, and other files on QuickLook without opening the file.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Get-the-App-on-GitHub"><a href="#Part-2-Get-the-App-on-GitHub" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Get the App on GitHub"></a>Part 2: Get the App on GitHub</h2><p>If you can’t find QuickLook on Microsoft Store for one reason or another, download the program from GitHub. It’s an open-source community where millions of software developers converge to distribute and share their work. Here, you can download and install multiple desktop programs and plugins for free. However, you must be a registered member to contribute any content.</p><p>So, without wasting time, let’s go through the steps to download the QuickLook plugin from GitHub. Follow me!</p><p>Step1 Visit the <a class="link"   href="https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook" >QuickLook GitHub <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> page and then navigate to Releases.

Then, download the plugins to add additional preview capabilities to Microsoft QuickLook. For example, install the FontViewer, FFmpeg, and OfficeViewer plugins by clicking the respective “Link” buttons.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/quicklook-for-windows-5.jpg"                      alt="install quicklook for windows plugins"                ></p><p>Step4 After a successful installation, find the file you want to preview and select it. Then, tap the space bar to preview the files. And remember, browse ZIP files to view all content.</p><p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: We recommend installing the QuickLook OfficeViewer plugin to rip open your Office files and view the content inside. This method is recommended if you haven’t installed Microsoft Office on your PC. However, you might notice that the OfficeViewer plugin isn’t supported on your Windows PC. So to install OfficeViewer, select the file and click the space bar to preview it on QuickLook. Then, tap the “Click here to install this plugin” button. Now restart QuickLook and view all your office documents without opening them on their respective programs.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Should-We-Expect-Built-in-Quick-Look-on-Windows-in-the-Future"><a href="#Part-3-Should-We-Expect-Built-in-Quick-Look-on-Windows-in-the-Future" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Should We Expect Built-in Quick Look on Windows in the Future?"></a>Part 3: Should We Expect Built-in Quick Look on Windows in the Future?</h2><p>Mac users have enjoyed the powerful QuickLook capabilities for at least 15 years. But are we going to see QuickLook coming to Windows 10&#x2F;11 anytime soon? According to sources, plans are already underway to add this feature to Microsoft Windows and rename it Peek. After selecting a file on Explorer, simply tap the Shift + Space bar to preview the content. Like the macOS version, you can preview PDFs, Excels, Words, images, videos, audio, and pretty much anything.</p><p>Meanwhile, it’s expected that QuickLook will come with a small preview screen. However, that should be enough space to preview whatever file you’re searching for. Also, it’s expected that Windows will embed the QuickLook capabilities into the Photos app. But it’s not yet clear if Peek will work with media files like videos and audio as it is on Mac.</p><p>In other related news, Microsoft will be answering the prayers of their loyal patrons to get tabbed browsing. This is another feature similar to what you currently have on macOS, where you can open new tabs for numerous file locations. In return, this makes moving and copying files more straightforward. This easy-to-navigate addition will definitely make Microsoft Windows users more productive than before.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123735/7443" target="_top" id="2123735">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123735" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123735/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-Frequently-Asked-Questions"><a href="#Part-4-Frequently-Asked-Questions" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Frequently Asked Questions"></a>Part 4: Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h4 id="1-Which-digital-file-formats-are-compatible-with-QuickLook"><a href="#1-Which-digital-file-formats-are-compatible-with-QuickLook" class="headerlink" title="1.

Multitasking is also possible, which is convenient for people with little free time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-1.jpg"                      alt="podcast live"                ></p><p>So, to make the most of your time spent listening to podcasts, here are some ideas on what you can do while listening! Keep reading to find out more.</p><h2 id="When-Listening-to-a-Podcast-What-Is-Appropriate-To-Do"><a href="#When-Listening-to-a-Podcast-What-Is-Appropriate-To-Do" class="headerlink" title="When Listening to a Podcast, What Is Appropriate To Do?"></a>When Listening to a Podcast, What Is Appropriate To Do?</h2><p>You do not need to dedicate a specific time to listen to podcasts. The entire idea of the podcast is auto-based information and shows to entertain users while doing something tedious and tiresome.</p><p>It allows you to fill those moments by learning new things and improving cognitive skills. Plus, it is a side-effect of doing things like driving, walking the dog, and commuting to work. Basically, all these tasks should meet all these or one of these criteria:</p><h3 id="●-No-need-to-use-your-brain"><a href="#●-No-need-to-use-your-brain" class="headerlink" title="● No need to use your brain"></a>● No need to use your brain</h3><p>Tasks like commuting, taking a bath, or doing dishes are subconscious. Yes, you can make them mindful and also make their meditative process. But if you are still bored, it is best to fill these little moments of your day with information-rich podcasts. Any mindless task is an opportunity. You do not need to devote any attention to these tasks and can listen to podcasts during this time.</p><h3 id="●-Thing-is-able-to-do-independently"><a href="#●-Thing-is-able-to-do-independently" class="headerlink" title="● Thing is able to do independently"></a>● Thing is able to do independently</h3><p>Collaborative work involves communicating with others. So, it is usually best to listen to the podcast when doing something independently. But this does not mean you should always listen to the podcast when doing independent work only. Even if you are surrounded by others and working on something independently, then you can fill the time with the podcast.</p><p>Moreover, some things like when you are driving with someone or you are on a road trip, and the other person also enjoys listening to the podcast, then you can fill the time with podcast episodes that interest you both. This also allows you to talk about the episodes and the ideas discussed there, and you both will have something to talk about.</p><h3 id="●-Repetitive"><a href="#●-Repetitive" class="headerlink" title="● Repetitive"></a>● Repetitive</h3><p>You can tune in to the podcasts for repetitive tasks like doing the dishes, gardening, etc. The idea is to complement the repetitive task with something useful.</p><h2 id="15-Things-To-Do-While-Listening-To-Podcasts"><a href="#15-Things-To-Do-While-Listening-To-Podcasts" class="headerlink" title="15 Things To Do While Listening To Podcasts"></a>15 Things To Do While Listening To Podcasts</h2><p>That said, here’s a short list of things to do while listening to a podcast. It is important to note that not all of you might be doing these tasks, but you must be doing something along these lines. So, it is all about familiarizing you with mindless tasks and how you can make the most of that activity by complementing it with a podcast episode.</p><h3 id="1-Yoga-or-stretch"><a href="#1-Yoga-or-stretch" class="headerlink" title="1. Yoga or stretch"></a>1. Yoga or stretch</h3><p>As surprising as this might sound, listening to a podcast during Yoga or stretch is a great way to spice things up. Although most folks might prefer to combine yoga or gym with music, you can still listen to an information-packed yoga Podcast.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-2.jpg"                      alt="yoga podcast"                ></p><p>Besides, once you learn the stretch or yoga positions, it becomes a subconscious process. So, chances are, you might not need music to do the stretches or exercises you’ve already learned. Overall, a good yoga podcast will help improve your knowledge of the yoga field!</p><h3 id="2-Jogging"><a href="#2-Jogging" class="headerlink" title="2. Jogging"></a>2. Jogging</h3><p>Jogging appeals for its mindlessness is prominent among people. Just one foot in front of the other is all jogging and running demands. Again, most people listen to music while on a jog or run. However, you can switch from music to your favorite podcasts easily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-3.jpg"                      alt="jogging podcast"                ></p><p>Listening to podcasts is a mindful activity, so when you run or jog with a podcast episode playing in your ears, it is easy to get distracted. So, it is vital to jog or run in a safe environment while listening to podcasts.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134501/19576" target="_top" id="2134501">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2134501" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="640" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134501/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Fishing"><a href="#3-Fishing" class="headerlink" title="3. Fishing"></a>3. Fishing</h3><p>Many people think about an activity that involves catching fish. However, catching fish is just part of fishing. In reality, it is the moments you share with your family, see new things, and experience new challenges, and that is what fishing is all about.</p><p>If you go fishing often and listen to music or sit with your friends, you can instead listen to a podcast episode this time and create a different experience for everyone in the group.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-4.jpg"                      alt="fishing podcast"                ></p><p>Moreover, listening to a podcast while fishing does not mean you should start the podcast only when you sit near the lake or pond to fish. It is the entire process; you can start your podcast episodes right from when you take your car, the breaks you take, and while returning too. Try this one when you go fishing and dedicate all the time you set for fishing to listening to podcasts.</p><h3 id="4-Organize-your-photos-or-files"><a href="#4-Organize-your-photos-or-files" class="headerlink" title="4. Organize your photos or files"></a>4. Organize your photos or files</h3><p>If you often take time to organize your photos or files, you can combine that process with listening to your favorite podcasts. As mentioned, listening to a podcast is about concentrating on it and understanding the ideas discussed. So, you can do that with any mindless activities.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-5.jpg"                      alt="organizing podcast"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115914/19272" target="_top" id="2115914">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115914" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115914/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>The benefit of combining listening to a podcast while organizing your photos or files is that you can learn new things and simplify your life by organizing your folders filled with countless images and files you always want to manage.

Nevertheless, even if you follow podcasts discussing astronomy or rocket science, cooking is one of the best things to do while listening to podcasts, it saves time, and you also enjoy a healthy and delicious meal.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-6.jpg"                      alt="cooking podcast"                ></p><p>Chopping vegetables or meat, the washing process, and food preparation are some activities that consume a lot of time of people, so filling this with information-rich podcasts is a good substitute for your time.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983475">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983475.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983475">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983475.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983475%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983475/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="6-Driving"><a href="#6-Driving" class="headerlink" title="6.

It’s time-consuming, unceasing, and seems like a never-ending process you do not want to engage in.</p><p>However, podcasts are made for such times and hurtful tasks like doing laundry or folding laundry. You can grab your headphones and tune in to your favorite podcast episode, making doing laundry an information-filled session and more effective.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-8.jpg"                      alt="laundry podcast"                ></p><p>Better yet, swift to hand-laundering. Hand laundering has a bad rep, but it is one of the best ways to burn some calories. Sometimes, hand-laundering is necessary; for instance, if you have to wash an expensive garment or want to avoid going to the laundromat, combine the entire process with your favorite podcast playing in your ears.</p><h3 id="8-Gardening"><a href="#8-Gardening" class="headerlink" title="8.

The process only works if you can combine both tasks without compromising on one.</p><h3 id="9-Walk-the-dog"><a href="#9-Walk-the-dog" class="headerlink" title="9. Walk the dog"></a>9. Walk the dog</h3><p>Walking the dog is a meditative process. It’s about appreciating the surroundings, reconnecting with nature, and bonding with our four-legged friend while roaming the city’s surroundings.</p><p>However, listening to podcasts while walking your dog can also be a new experience. Not only can you listen to your podcasts, but if you choose the right one, you will cry and laugh as you walk the dog.</p><p>Besides, podcasts are one of the most followed things by dog-loving communities. A lot of people have the habit of tuning in to their favorite podcasts while walking their dogs, and you can be one of them.</p><h3 id="10-Do-the-Dishes"><a href="#10-Do-the-Dishes" class="headerlink" title="10. Do the Dishes"></a>10. Do the Dishes</h3><p>If we have to inform this, it means you are not having fun while doing the dishes. Doing dishes is one of the chores which you should take as a challenge and make really fun. The fun could be of different types, like timing yourself or racing with someone else. In this case, you can play your favorite podcast episodes and listen to them daily while doing the dishes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-10.jpg"                      alt="dishes podcast"                ></p><p>The fun, the learning, and the sense of doing something different hits differently when you combine podcasts with doing dishes; not to forget, you made something of the time that you hate the most of your day.</p><h3 id="11-Paint-your-nails"><a href="#11-Paint-your-nails" class="headerlink" title="11. Paint your nails"></a>11. Paint your nails</h3><p>Painting nails is once again one of those processes that are initially elegant and important for girls. However, the waiting time while you are drying out the nail polish is the worst. However, doing something fun like playing your high-beat music with dancing as you’ve never danced before takes you into an astral world and allows you to experience a different side of yourself. This time, however, try playing the newest episode from your favorite podcast. And note down your experience once you complete it.</p><h3 id="12-Take-a-bath"><a href="#12-Take-a-bath" class="headerlink" title="12. Take a bath"></a>12.

It is one of the best ways to reset, relax, and recharge yourself after a tiresome day. You should always make your bathes meditative or go really far into a spiritual process.</p><p>Try this: set the right temperature of the water, add essential oils to the bathtub, light some candles, and play your favorite podcast. Believe me, soon, taking a bath while listening to a podcast will become one of the best moments of your day.</p><h3 id="13-Commute"><a href="#13-Commute" class="headerlink" title="13. Commute"></a>13. Commute</h3><p>Daily commutes occupy a large part of everyone’s day. Yes, the work from home is becoming a reality. But that reality is still far in the future. Until then, you have to commute to work, children to school, groceries, and so on. Well, you can fill these times with information-rich podcasts and learn new things.</p><p>It sounds like you might not focus and listen to the podcast like you would at home. But you’ll be amazed at how well you can adapt podcast listening while commuting in a bus or train filled with people.</p><h3 id="14-Clean-the-house"><a href="#14-Clean-the-house" class="headerlink" title="14.

If you truly enjoy listening to the podcast, play it on your home theatre and listen to the episodes as you clean your house.</p><p>Most people ignore these beautiful tasks of the day, thinking they will be wasting their time, and often hire a housemaid. But that’s the beauty of the modern world; you can make these tasks fun and entertaining if only complemented with the right podcasts or music.</p><h3 id="15-Haircut-or-hair-dye"><a href="#15-Haircut-or-hair-dye" class="headerlink" title="15. Haircut or hair dye"></a>15. Haircut or hair dye</h3><p>A haircut is a time that you give to your barber. It is all about sitting on the chair and letting the masters do their work. And putting on earphones for listening to music and podcast can be disastrous, as one snip and your costly earphones will be gone for good.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-13.jpg"                      alt="haircut podcast"                ></p><p>However, you can make the time of everyone sitting at the saloon beautiful by simply asking the barber to play one of the podcasts they like or you like. This will also allow you to experience new podcasts you aren’t familiar with and initiate a good conversation with your client.</p><h2 id="Summing-up"><a href="#Summing-up" class="headerlink" title="Summing up"></a>Summing up</h2><p>The above list of things to do while listening to podcasts is all about acquainting you with tedious tasks and making them beautiful.</p><p>As mentioned, you can complement a podcast episode with any boring task you have to do daily and make your time most effective and fun.</p><p>Overall, there are too many mindless things that you have to do daily; simply remember to carry your earphones and make that mindless activity into a beautiful, fun, and informative session.</p><p>Using podcasts to learn and entertain is a great idea. Multitasking is also possible, which is convenient for people with little free time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/things-to-do-while-listening-to-podcasts-1.jpg"                      alt="podcast live"                ></p><p>So, to make the most of your time spent listening to podcasts, here are some ideas on what you can do while listening!

This is due to the launch of platforms like Twitch and Youtube, which have made it easier for content creators&#x2F;streamers to reach a wide audience. But how do these two platforms differ?</p><p>In this article, we’ll take a comprehensive look at <strong>Twitch vs. Youtube</strong> by comparing their browsing, content rule leniency, growth, and monetization. By the end, you’ll have a good understanding of which platform is right for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/twitch-vs-youtube.jpg"                      alt="twitch vs youtube"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-The-Key-Differences-Between-Twitch-and-YouTube"><a href="#Part-1-The-Key-Differences-Between-Twitch-and-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. The Key Differences Between Twitch and YouTube"></a>Part 1. The Key Differences Between Twitch and YouTube</h2><p>Though Twitch and YouTube share some similarities, there are also some key differences between the two:</p><p><strong>Browsing:</strong> Twitch and YouTube are search engines, but they differ in how they recommend videos to viewers. Twitch focuses on more popular streamers and doesn’t let users edit their thumbnails, while YouTube makes it easier for newbies to be found with a customizable thumbnail feature.</p><p><strong>Content Rule Leniency:</strong> Twitch and YouTube’s content guidelines are slightly different. YouTube is more easygoing when it comes to what videos can be posted. On the other hand, Twitch has a reputation for banning streamers without any justification. Even streamers with contracts seem to be treated the same as anyone else when this happens.</p><p><strong>Growth:</strong> YouTube offers more advantages over Twitch in terms of growth as it is more accessible and has a better algorithm that allows small content creators to grow their channels quickly. However, Twitch mainly focuses on popular content streamers and offers fewer growth opportunities for newbies.</p><p><strong>Monetization:</strong> When it comes to monetization, both platforms offer different options for content creators. On Twitch, content creators can earn revenue from subscriptions, sponsored advertisements, donations, affiliate programs, merchandise sales, etc. On YouTube, content creators can earn revenue from direct advertisements, sponsorships, partnership programs, streams, donations, etc.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/youtube-monetization.jpg"                      alt="youtube monetization"                ></p><p><strong>Chat and Moderation Policies:</strong> Twitch uses a time-based strict chat moderation policy and does not have the pause or rewind option. While on YouTube, the chat is arranged based on relevance and comes with only standard emojis for visual presentation.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Comparison-of-Two-Important-Features-Between-Twitch-and-YOUTUBE-Partnership-and-Gaming"><a href="#Part-2-Comparison-of-Two-Important-Features-Between-Twitch-and-YOUTUBE-Partnership-and-Gaming" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

These include a consistent uploading or streaming schedule, viewer engagement on your content, certain watch times, and the required number of subscribers on your channel.</p><p>Unlike YouTube, Twitch offers both affiliate and partnership programs.

Over the past few years, two of the biggest platforms for streaming gaming content have been Twitch and YouTube. So which platform is worth using? Let’s find out!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/twitch-gaming.jpg"                      alt="twitch gaming"                ></p><p><strong>Algorithm:</strong> Twitch algorithm is mainly based on the number of viewers on your videos. Moreover, when browsing, it mainly suggests only the popular streamers with a strong subscriber base.</p><p>On the other hand, YouTube is owned by Google and creates more opportunities for streamers to be found. Also, its search algorithm takes into account the number of likes, comments, and shares on your video.</p><p><strong>Streamer-Viewer Dynamics:</strong> On Twitch, viewers often get more involved with the streamer as opposed to YouTube gaming viewers, who prefer to watch videos without commentary.</p><p><strong>Engagement Requirements For Streamers:</strong> To grow on YouTube, you need at least 4000 hours of watch time and a good number of likes, shares, and comments on your video. While on Twitch, you need at least a 20-30% engagement rate and a large number of subscribers.</p><p><strong>Competition Level Of Streamer:</strong> YouTube has fewer streamers but a 20 times more extensive user base. The potential for growth for new streamers is much higher due to the lower competition on the platform. Additionally, the platform provides more prominent exposure for new content creators.</p><h3 id="Verdict"><a href="#Verdict" class="headerlink" title="Verdict"></a>Verdict</h3><p>Twitch is a better streaming platform if you want to cultivate a following around your content. Although creating your followers’ community at first can be difficult, it largely depends on how engaging and compelling your content is.</p><p>As a new content creator or a streamer to create and upload pre-recorded videos, YouTube is a better choice for you. Make sure to upload the most enthralling games to keep your audience captivating and interested.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Does-Twitch-Or-YouTube-Pay-More"><a href="#Part-3-Does-Twitch-Or-YouTube-Pay-More" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Does Twitch Or YouTube Pay More?"></a>Part 3. Does Twitch Or YouTube Pay More?</h2><p>The amount of revenue you can make on Twitch or YouTube is directly related to your follower base. The higher the number of followers&#x2F;viewers, the more you will earn. Here’s how each platform pays its streamers.</p><h3 id="How-Twitch-Pay-Their-Streamers"><a href="#How-Twitch-Pay-Their-Streamers" class="headerlink" title="How Twitch Pay Their Streamers"></a>How Twitch Pay Their Streamers</h3><p>There are five ways in which you can make money while streaming your content on Twitch:</p><p><strong>Ads:</strong> You can turn on ads on your content when your stream gets the affiliate’s status. Ad revenues are based on the number of impressions (views) your content receives, and the average payout is $0.25 - $1.50 per 1,000 views.</p><p><strong>Bits</strong>: As a streamer on Twitch, you can also receive donations from your viewers in the form of a unique currency on the platform known as Bits. It’s important to note that Twitch takes a 29% cut-off of all donations made this way, leaving the streamer with 71% of the total donation. We have a complete guide to help you understand <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >what Twitch Bits are and how to earn&#x2F;get them for free. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/twitch-bits.jpg"                      alt="twitch bits"                ></p><p><strong>Donations:</strong> Donations made through Paypal or other monetary exchange platforms benefit the streamer as they will receive 100% of the donation. This is the cheaper way of ensuring that the streamer gets the entire donation amount from the viewer.</p><p><strong>Subscribers:</strong> Subscribers can support your channel by getting a subscription for a minimum of $4.99 per month. Twitch only takes 50% of subscription fees. This makes it much more profitable for streamers, as they can earn $2.50 per subscription per month.</p><p><strong>Merchandise:</strong> In terms of merchandise, Twitch has an advantage over YouTube because it comes with various merchandising extensions that can help you to make sales directly to your viewers during a live stream without the need for them to leave the screen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/twitch-monetization.jpg"                      alt="twitch monetization"                ></p><h3 id="How-YouTube-Pay-Their-Streamers"><a href="#How-YouTube-Pay-Their-Streamers" class="headerlink" title="How YouTube Pay Their Streamers"></a>How YouTube Pay Their Streamers</h3><p>YouTube pays its streamers in three different ways:</p><p><strong>Ads:</strong> Once your channel reaches a specific threshold, you become eligible for displaying ads on your YouTube channel. YouTube ads pay more than Twitch. For each 1000 ad views, you will get $18, which means you can earn up to $3 to $5 per 1k video views.</p><p><strong>Members:</strong> YouTube members are equivalent to Twitch’s subscribers. YouTube pays 70% of membership fees to the creators. The eligibility to offer channel memberships opens up at 30,000 subscribers for all types of channels, but for gaming channels, in particular, a minimum of 1,000 subscribers are required. Additionally, creators must also be a part of the YouTube Partner Program.</p><p><strong>Super Chat:</strong> Youtube pays streamers 70% of each super chat donation made on the platform and retains 30%. While this may seem to be expensive, it helps cover the costs of hosting a Livestream. Without this donation, Youtube would not be able to function as smoothly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/youtube-super-chat.jpg"                      alt="youtube super chat"                ></p><h3 id="Which-Pays-More"><a href="#Which-Pays-More" class="headerlink" title="Which Pays More?"></a>Which Pays More?</h3><p>Due to the lower threshold for monetization, Twitch pays more to the new content creators and offers more monetization options. However, it is difficult to grow on Twitch compared to YouTube, which has a stronger user base.</p><p>YouTube is easier to generate income in the long run as you can upload recorded gaming videos which can get more viewers as it is always available on the platform. Moreover, you can also make more from YouTube ads than on Twitch.</p><p><strong>Video - Where Should You Stream in 2022? - Twitch vs YouTube Live</strong></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1975636">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975636.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1975636">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1975636.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1975636%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1975636/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="FAQs"><a href="#FAQs" class="headerlink" title="FAQs"></a>FAQs</h2><h3 id="How-Much-Do-YouTube-Gaming-Streamers-Make"><a href="#How-Much-Do-YouTube-Gaming-Streamers-Make" class="headerlink" title="How Much Do YouTube Gaming Streamers Make?"></a>How Much Do YouTube Gaming Streamers Make?</h3><p>On YouTube, a streamer mainly gets paid based on the ads, which is $0.10 to $0.30 per ad view.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-To-Be-A-Good-Interviewer"><a href="#How-To-Be-A-Good-Interviewer" class="headerlink" title="How To Be A Good Interviewer"></a>How To Be A Good Interviewer</h2><p>Creating a YouTube channel might be advantageous even if you have no intention of becoming a professional YouTuber. It’s a great opportunity to meet others who share your interests and form a community, and you can learn a lot of useful skills, like how to talk more confidently.</p><p>However, it might be difficult to distinguish out when there are so many talented channels in every imaginable field. Making a strong introduction for your films is one of the finest methods to capture the interest of your audience. What therefore ought to your YouTube intros contain? Discover all the crucial details by continuing to read this article.</p><h2 id="1-Keep-your-intro-brief"><a href="#1-Keep-your-intro-brief" class="headerlink" title="1. Keep your intro brief"></a>1. Keep your intro brief</h2><p>The average human attention span has decreased over time. You risk losing viewers if you prolong the beginning of your YouTube video beyond what is essential given the abundance of free materials available today.</p><p>Make sure that your introduction lasts no more than 10 seconds as a general rule of thumb. The shorter the better if you can manage it. Remember, you don’t have to give away everything in your film. You only need to give them enough of a reason to continue watching.</p><h2 id="2-Stay-in-the-theme"><a href="#2-Stay-in-the-theme" class="headerlink" title="2. Stay in the theme"></a>2. Stay in the theme</h2><p>While few rule-breakers have found success, the majority of well-liked YouTube channels have a distinct niche that attracts viewers and followers. Without it, you won’t be able to draw in and satisfy your target market.</p><p>Your opening should be consistent with your theme and branding across the entire YouTube channel. When you know the answers to those questions, you’ll be more equipped to create an interesting YouTube channel introduction.</p><h2 id="3-Make-the-first-7-seconds-count"><a href="#3-Make-the-first-7-seconds-count" class="headerlink" title="3. Make the first 7 seconds count"></a>3. Make the first 7 seconds count</h2><p>Although branding is important, it won’t guarantee views and subscribers for your YouTube intro. Your efforts will be in vain if you don’t provide your viewers a compelling incentive to stick around.</p><p>Making a great first impression is a must when planning the opening sequence for your YouTube channel. Try to highlight the value the audience will receive from viewing your films; a brief tagline that sums up your core principles is a good starting point.</p><p>Above all else, being genuine will help you make a good first impression. Others will see right through you and move on if you try to force a personality that isn’t yours or if it’s obvious that you’re not interested in the subjects you raise.</p><h2 id="4-Make-a-plan"><a href="#4-Make-a-plan" class="headerlink" title="4. Make a plan"></a>4. Make a plan</h2><p>The quantity of tasks you have to complete before your YouTube channel takes off is one of the most difficult aspects of launching one. If you don’t divide them up into manageable portions, you’ll probably start to feel overwhelmed very quickly.</p><p>One of the best things you can do is plan ahead when making an introduction for your YouTube channel. Making two or three prototypes and putting them through testing to discover which works best could also be helpful.</p><p>It’s important to keep in mind that while you should have a plan, you don’t necessarily need a very detailed one at this time. Have enough to launch you and allow you to make adjustments as you gain velocity.</p><h2 id="5-Include-a-Call-To-Action"><a href="#5-Include-a-Call-To-Action" class="headerlink" title="5. Include a Call-To-Action"></a>5. Include a Call-To-Action</h2><p>Now is the time to deal with any concerns you may have with asking people for things. You won’t get as a content creator if you don’t ask, and this also applies to YouTube.</p><p>After you’ve written your introduction, you might want to think about inserting a call to action (CTA). Users will be prompted to take the action you want them to, such as follow you on social media or subscribe to your channel, if you do this.</p><p>Your CTA needs to be brief and concise. If you make it sound too airy, your audience will miss the point and you’ll come out as uncertain of your goal.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134229/18498" target="_top" id="2134229">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134229" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134229/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="6-Keep-it-simple"><a href="#6-Keep-it-simple" class="headerlink" title="6.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Core-Tenets-of-Narrative-Construction"><a href="#Core-Tenets-of-Narrative-Construction" class="headerlink" title="Core Tenets of Narrative Construction"></a>Core Tenets of Narrative Construction</h2><p>Marketers are always looking for new ways to catch as many people’s attention as possible, and they use urgency, despair, discounted rates, and sales as bait. However, while these may work at first, twice, or even three times, they rarely produce long-term results.</p><p>Incorporating such <strong>storytelling in marketing</strong> captures attention, entices, and encourages potential customers — everything we need to close a sale. In addition, it encourages intimacy and trust — all of the additives for a fulfilling relationship.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/best-storytelling-in-marketing-sale-conversation.jpg"                      alt="best of storytelling in marketing sale conversation"                ></p><h2 id="What-is-Storytelling"><a href="#What-is-Storytelling" class="headerlink" title="What is Storytelling?"></a>What is Storytelling?</h2><p>Storytelling is an ancient form of interactive personal expression that expresses the narrative while revealing many images and circumstances to the listener. Stories have always facilitated communication. A good story can also be told effectively using photos, images, and movies.</p><p>In line with this, storytelling also seeks to convey an idea by igniting the audience’s imagination through the storyteller’s words to create an image. Using storytelling, you may even write your own digital story. Therefore, inspiring stories serve as motivators and positively impact individuals’ behavior. The skill and influence of emotional storytelling can alter people’s attitudes, instill loyalty, and inspire them to perform specific actions.</p><h2 id="Why-is-Content-Marketing-so-Important"><a href="#Why-is-Content-Marketing-so-Important" class="headerlink" title="Why is Content Marketing so Important?"></a>Why is Content Marketing so Important?</h2><p>Content marketing improves the company’s online reputation. Viewers are served a variety of content in the form of blog entries, videos, infographics, presentations, and social media posts. By providing value, you draw in the audience while establishing brand trust.</p><p>Below are some reasons why successful content marketing storytelling can increase your company’s success.</p><p><strong>1. Develops a powerful brand personality</strong></p><p>Every brand has specific principles and traits that customers connect with, whether you attempt to or not. A brand personality relates to “who” a consumer is speaking with; as a result, a firm must be genuine, incorporate their worldviews, and explain why it matters in the context of their personal story. Storytelling marketing encourages your clients to feel a part of something bigger.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/brand-personality-storytelling-marketing-digital.jpg"                      alt="brand personality in storytelling marketing digital"                ></p><p>The company’s story will be distinctive and interesting to the community if you take risky positions and emphasize your company principles. A memorable marketing narrative can make you stand out in a particular field, making you seem more like a friend than a faceless corporation.</p><p><strong>2. Builds an emotional connection and loyalty with customers</strong></p><p>People can identify with and interact with the finest tales because they feel something; as a result, they invest in the brand and what it advocates. The audience is likelier to like you and your business if they can relate to you or comprehend the steps that went into developing the brand.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/content-marketing-storytelling-customer-connection.jpg"                      alt="customer connection in content marketing storytelling"                ></p><p>The ability to create emotions through the narrative is a significant weapon since it is kept in mind that people rarely make reasonable judgments. To effectively express your goal, transform it into an engaging story and employ a real storytelling and marketing approach.</p><p><strong>3. Generating new leads</strong></p><p>Lead generation is essential for small businesses because they depend on steady traffic to develop their brand and increase revenue. In addition to being excellent for generating leads, content marketing is also reasonably priced. If your business is working toward objective clients can support, you have a significantly higher chance of success.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/storytelling-and-marketing-generate-new-leads.jpg"                      alt="storytelling and marketing generates new leads"                ></p><p>People prefer to make purchases from organizations they perceive to be sympathetic. It’s simple to see content marketing storytelling’s importance when considering the return on investment. Emotional storytelling reveals your company’s empathy, which will most likely contribute to commercial success.</p><h2 id="How-to-Become-a-Good-Storyteller-for-Marketing"><a href="#How-to-Become-a-Good-Storyteller-for-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="How to Become a Good Storyteller for Marketing?"></a>How to Become a Good Storyteller for Marketing?</h2><p>A great storyteller can make a good narrative even more powerful. Therefore, skilled storytellers can captivate their audience, guide them in the right direction, and leave readers or listeners with new information to assimilate and a lesson they may keep for the rest of their existence.</p><p>The techniques listed below will help you become a better storyteller for marketing.</p><p><strong>1. Pick a compelling main point</strong></p><p>The main moral or message of a great story usually develops throughout. When writing a story, you must know what you are aiming to have. No matter what story you want to tell, it’s important to be certain about the central idea or conceit around which it is built.</p><p><strong>2. Have a clear plot structure</strong></p><p>The story’s narrative acts as its main direction. It ensures the story has a beginning, middle, and end and all the enjoyable material; thus, it creates a comfortable environment for your audience and lets people concentrate on other elements of your marketing narrative. A satisfying conclusion will also give your audience a sense of closure. Only if you are positioning yourself for the following chapter is it permissible to leave your character holding to the cliff’s brink.</p><p><strong>3. Show empathy</strong></p><p>Highly empathic individuals who focus on what other people think and feel are excellent storytellers. When telling stories, using empathy can assist you in choosing the most powerful terminology to describe a perspective that focuses on how you believe your use of language would affect an audience.</p><p><strong>4. Make it your own</strong></p><p>Consider providing a personal touch when delivering a narrative, whether it is to entertain or market a product. Your pitch will have the “genuine” factor with a personal touch. It is communicated through a testimonial. If you’re writing a story to entertain the audience, use your personal experiences to enrich the marketing narrative. This tip will give your story a more genuine sense.</p><p><strong>5. Feature appealing characters</strong></p><p>The character must be endearing if you desire your audience to root to see them succeed. Let your audience witness the development of emotions that your character experiences. Nothing is more depressing than a motionless character. Show them whoever your character is rather than telling them.</p><p><strong>6. Engage your audience</strong></p><p>A key component of effective visual storytelling marketing is engaging your audience, but how you do so largely relies on the type of storytelling marketing you’re doing. Consider your audience whenever you decide how to tell your narrative.</p><h2 id="How-can-Storytelling-in-Marketing-be-Presented-Finally"><a href="#How-can-Storytelling-in-Marketing-be-Presented-Finally" class="headerlink" title="How can Storytelling in Marketing be Presented Finally?"></a>How can Storytelling in Marketing be Presented Finally?</h2><p><strong>1. Text</strong></p><p>Written stories mostly consist of text, though they may also include pertinent imagery. Since this kind of story only needs paper and a pen or even some free writing software like Google Docs, it is also the most accessible and the simplest to write. A blog entry, an essay, and sometimes even a book are effective ways for a written story to reach its intended audience.</p><p>The best example of this type is the “socially aware, designer eyewear at revolutionary pricing” story from <a class="link"   href="https://www.warbyparker.com/history" >Warby Parker. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Instead of merely declaring things are cheap, they provide more context for the assertion by telling a story that explains why they are. He goes so far as to write stories explaining his beginnings on their cleaning cloths, adding a personalized experience and making it more efficient in storytelling and marketing.</p><p><strong>2. Audio</strong></p><p>These stories are very similar to textual stories, except that they are recorded. Technology breakthroughs have made it more accessible than ever to produce audio stories. Podcasts are typically used to tell such a marketing narrative. Great podcasters can blend emotional storytelling into their podcasts to make them entertaining and digestible while inspiring people to act.</p><p>This kind of podcast is exemplified by Camela Thompson from <a class="link"   href="https://calibermind.com/thought-leadership/podcasts/" >CaliberMind’s The Revenue Marketing Report. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Additionally, it is a podcast that primarily serves as a tool for education. On the show’s blogs, the features of each episode are presented, and on the website, you can arrange the episodes by genre.</p><p><strong>3. Photo</strong></p><p>A portion of photographic storytelling includes taking pictures of intriguing situations and events that are difficult to describe in words. These images either convey the tale of a fascinating person or people in an underappreciated setting or take on civil liberties or awareness aspects by highlighting the suffering of those living in impoverished or conflict-torn areas.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://static.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Javier-Arcenillas-5e418762e61ba-jpeg%5F%5F880.jpg" >“Latinoamerica,” <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> a long-term piece by Javier Arcenilla, is an illustration of this kind. The photographer set out to capture the core of unchecked brutality in Latin America, the political and social forces that tenaciously support it, and the will to stop it. It is regarded as one of the best examples of how photography is used in storytelling in marketing.</p><p><strong>4. Video</strong></p><p>The best tools for collecting and sharing emotions are digital stories. Videos are used to narrate these stories. They cost the most to make, considering that they are the most advanced.</p><p>Fortunately, inexpensive video editing software may give your video story a polished, expert appearance without costing a fortune. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a fantastic video editor for creating content marketing storytelling because it has a handy timeline, the option to merge and edit audio and video recordings separately, powerful effects, and the opportunity to customize the interface.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/assets/images-common/icon-note.png"                                     ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2120867/26400?prodsku=mars" target="_top" id="2120867">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2120867" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2120867/26400?prodsku=mars"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong><em>Note: For further details, go to <a class="link"   href="https://youtu.be/u2i39suoH5c" >Wondershare Filmora 11 | More Than Just You. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em></strong></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135354/19272" target="_top" id="2135354">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135354" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135354/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Start-Your-Marketing-Storytelling-Tour"><a href="#Start-Your-Marketing-Storytelling-Tour" class="headerlink" title="Start Your Marketing Storytelling Tour"></a>Start Your Marketing Storytelling Tour</h2><p>Content marketing and storytelling go seamlessly together.

For short URLs (youtu.be) use “?t&#x3D;Xs” where X&#x3D;seconds or “?t&#x3D;XmYs” where X&#x3D;minutes and S&#x3D; seconds. Replace “?” with “&amp;” for long URLs (youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v&#x3D;). Adjust the “X” and “Y” values to your specified pause time.</li><li>Save the edited URL in Notepad, post it in a social media app, or paste it into a mobile browser.</li></ol><p>Finally, remember that the formula for a time period is t&#x3D;Xs or t&#x3D;XmYs. You modify X and Y to reflect your own time values. Short URLs starting with “youtu.be” use “?” first, while long URLs starting with “youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v&#x3D;” use “&amp;” before the time data.</p><h3 id="5-Using-link-generator-to-add-timestamp"><a href="#5-Using-link-generator-to-add-timestamp" class="headerlink" title="5.

How to add a timestamp in YouTube comments or description</h2><p>If you are a Youtuber and your videos are informative, adding a jumpable timestamp in the comments or description will make it easier for viewers to understand your videos. The duration of your video will also grow if viewers keep returning to a certain piece of it.</p><p>Here’s the guide to adding a timestamp to a YouTube comment or description:</p><ol><li>Select the time you want to link to</li><li>Pause the video and note the time</li><li>Write the time in the comment</li><li>Post your comment</li></ol><p>The process is simple - just write the time you want to redirect viewers to in the comment. The timestamp format is hours:minutes:seconds (no spaces). Make sure the time format is correct, then a timestamp with a jump link will be generated automatically.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>YouTubers want videos to be short and to the point. However, if the video needs to be longer, you can help users browse and find what’s important to them by adding a timestamp to the YouTube link or a timestamp to the YouTube descriptions. This can help your viewers go directly to the interesting part of the video instead of watching the entire video, saving them time, and improving the user experience. The most recommended way to the timestamp on YouTube is using a built-in function in YouTube.</p><p>Timestamps can help you share information with your audience without having to watch unimportant segments. If you’re only focusing on a certain part of the video, you can link directly to it to save time.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p>Part 1.

How to add a timestamp in YouTube comments or description</h2><p>If you are a Youtuber and your videos are informative, adding a jumpable timestamp in the comments or description will make it easier for viewers to understand your videos. The duration of your video will also grow if viewers keep returning to a certain piece of it.</p><p>Here’s the guide to adding a timestamp to a YouTube comment or description:</p><ol><li>Select the time you want to link to</li><li>Pause the video and note the time</li><li>Write the time in the comment</li><li>Post your comment</li></ol><p>The process is simple - just write the time you want to redirect viewers to in the comment. The timestamp format is hours:minutes:seconds (no spaces). Make sure the time format is correct, then a timestamp with a jump link will be generated automatically.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>YouTubers want videos to be short and to the point. However, if the video needs to be longer, you can help users browse and find what’s important to them by adding a timestamp to the YouTube link or a timestamp to the YouTube descriptions. This can help your viewers go directly to the interesting part of the video instead of watching the entire video, saving them time, and improving the user experience. The most recommended way to the timestamp on YouTube is using a built-in function in YouTube.</p><p>Timestamps can help you share information with your audience without having to watch unimportant segments. If you’re only focusing on a certain part of the video, you can link directly to it to save time.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/new-add-videos-to-youtube-playlist/"><u>[New] Add Videos to YouTube Playlist</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/new-comprehensive-walkthrough-installing-windows-movie-maker-60/"><u>[New] Comprehensive Walkthrough Installing Windows Movie Maker 6.0</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-surging-interest-through-effective-strategies-for-fb-giveaway-promotions/"><u>[New] Surging Interest Through Effective Strategies for FB Giveaway Promotions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/best-android-data-recovery-retrieve-lost-pictures-from-reno-8t-by-fonelab-android-recover-pictures/"><u>Best Android Data Recovery - Retrieve Lost Pictures from Reno 8T.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-tips.techidaily.com/choosing-your-perfect-graphics-processing-unit-gpu-an-in-depth-purchase-guide/"><u>Choosing Your Perfect Graphics Processing Unit (GPU): An In-Depth Purchase Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-renaissance.techidaily.com/dragon-training-watch-the-how-to-train-your-dragon-series-the-complete-sequential-guide/"><u>Dragon Training: Watch the How to Train Your Dragon Series - The Complete Sequential Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/in-2024-broadcast-brains-vs-bodies-finding-the-frontier/"><u>In 2024, Broadcast Brains Vs Bodies Finding the Frontier</u></a></li><li><a href="https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-change-location-on-facebook-dating-for-your-itel-p55-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Change Location On Facebook Dating for your Itel P55 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/mac-windows-vmx-substitute/"><u>Mac-Windows VMX Substitute</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/perfecting-picture-presentation-top-frames-of-2024/"><u>Perfecting Picture Presentation - Top Frames of 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techidaily.com/recover-apple-iphone-13-data-from-icloud-drfone-by-drfone-ios-data-recovery-ios-data-recovery/"><u>Recover Apple iPhone 13 Data From iCloud | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-8-top-collaborative-video-collage-tools-on-android-affordable/"><u>The Ultimate 8 Top Collaborative Video Collage Tools on Android (Affordable)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-approaches.techidaily.com/ultimate-guide-eliminating-jaggies-from-interlaced-footage-with-advanced-deinterlacing-techniques/"><u>Ultimate Guide: Eliminating Jaggies From Interlaced Footage with Advanced Deinterlacing Techniques</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

To guide you through the process, we’ll explain the basics of color and outline the best color editing software packages and apps for fine-tuning the colors in your footage.</em></p><p>Color sorting is an exciting practice of patience, skillful tinkering, and a feeling for atmosphere. Creating stellar looks for a photo or video is a fun way to create a visual experience while maintaining a level of artistic integrity. While advanced artists may prefer larger software programs like Adobe Premiere or DaVinci Resolve, there are excellent, simpler applications built entirely for beginners. In fact, you don’t have to be a beginner to use these apps, as many of them use more manual controls for precise adjustments. The advancements readily available for iOS and iPad these days are stellar, and we’re here to help point you in the right direction.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-color-correction"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-color-correction" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is color correction?"></a>Part 1. What is color correction?</h2><p>Color correction refers to the process of adjusting each clip of footage to meet a consistent standard of appearance. Basically, it’s about correcting the underlying image issues by balancing the colors, making white appear white, black appear black, and making sure everything is even. The goal is to match the video footage to a standard that would accurately represent how the human eye would see it.</p><p>An example of this is when you are shooting outdoors during the day. During the day, the quality of the sun will change, and some shots of your video will not match. This is why color correction is important because it will make your video look like it was all shot at the same time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-grading-app-1.jpg"                      alt="color grading app"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Best-color-correction-app"><a href="#Part-2-Best-color-correction-app" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

The credit, specifically, goes to our experience of the COVID 19 pandemic that necessitated that our daily lives become digitized at a rapid pace. The problem has it that although the concept has gained wide currency, people often confuse the two kinds of universes that give body to this gradually prevailing Virtual World, Metaverse and Multiverse. Take this article therefore as the ultimate guide concerning the subject.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-vs-multiverse.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse vs. Multiverse"                ></p><p>Source: bernardmarr.com</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What Is Metaverse and What Is Multiverse?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">A Comprehensive Comparison between Metaverse and Multiverse</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">What Is the Future of Metaverse?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Metaverse-and-What-Is-Multiverse"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Metaverse-and-What-Is-Multiverse" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is Metaverse and What Is Multiverse?"></a>Part 1: What Is Metaverse and What Is Multiverse?</h2><p>As the sounds that these words produce denote, they come closer to each other and yet remain separate from each other. So what are they and why this distinction?</p><p>Metaverse was first envisioned by the American author Neal Stephenson in 1992 in his sci-fi novel ‘Snow Crash’. Although the world has moved on since 1992, it seems today that we have put all our updated resources to manifest Stephenson’s vision of the Metaverse. With reference to the novel then, the word points toward a virtual space that is accessible to real people given they enter it in their virtual avatars which are customizable. While in it, they can interact with a whole host of virtual objects as truthfully and extensively as we experience this real world of objects surrounding us.</p><p>The origin of the other concept, Multiverse, recedes much more in time and has its source in cosmology, quantum mechanics, and philosophy. To cut through the academic jargon, a Multiverse is an assemblage of alternate universes consisting of events that remain accessible to users as long as they are within the Multiverse. As Yanis Varoufakis, the former Finance Minister of Greece has recently put down, if Jill wants and unwilling Jack to go mountaineering with her and Jack, on his part, wants instead to go the beach with Jill, in a Multiverse both these alternatives remain alive and accessible to both of them. Time and space as the two biggest constraints defining our reality thus vanish here.</p><h2 id="Part-2-A-Comprehensive-Comparison-between-Metaverse-and-Multiverse"><a href="#Part-2-A-Comprehensive-Comparison-between-Metaverse-and-Multiverse" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: A Comprehensive Comparison between Metaverse and Multiverse"></a>Part 2: A Comprehensive Comparison between Metaverse and Multiverse</h2><p>Now that the basic ideas behind these two words are dealt with, it is fairly easy to delineate the differences that keep alive the Metaverse vs. Multiverse debate.</p><h3 id="1-Number-of-Universes"><a href="#1-Number-of-Universes" class="headerlink" title="1. Number of Universes"></a>1. Number of Universes</h3><p>One of the very basic features that underline the Metaverse vs. Multiverse debate is this one. Whereas Metaverse denotes only one universe, a Multiverse is a collection of an unending number of metaverses functioning side by side.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-vs-multiverse-number.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse vs. Multiverse"                ></p><p>Source: techrepublic.com</p><h3 id="2-Order"><a href="#2-Order" class="headerlink" title="2. Order"></a>2. Order</h3><p>Another big factor that distances a Metaverse from a Multiverse is that the former surrenders to the laws of Time and Space and so events and objects here are orderly, unlike a Multiverse. In a Metaverse then, events follow each other in a timely fashion just as two different places don’t overlap at any given time. In a Multiverse, because it is beyond time and space, witnessing randomness is pretty common.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-vs-multiverse-order.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse vs. Multiverse"                ></p><p>Source: themetaversereviewer.com</p><h3 id="3-Entities"><a href="#3-Entities" class="headerlink" title="3. Entities"></a>3. Entities</h3><p>A Metaverse is a virtual space populated by entities like virtual doppelgangers of human users, Artificial Intelligence, virtual objects, etc. whereas theoretically, a Multiverse is bereft of all these. It is when one jumps from one Metaverse to the other within a Multiverse does one finds all these specificities.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-vs-multiverse-entities.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse vs. Multiverse"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115944/19272" target="_top" id="2115944">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115944" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115944/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Weather-Condition"><a href="#4-Weather-Condition" class="headerlink" title="4. Weather Condition"></a>4. Weather Condition</h3><p>This is another factor that features in the arc of Metaverse vs. Multiverse narrative. Metaverse, being a replication of this real-world, has its specific weather conditions that users can manipulate nonetheless. But a Multiverse features an infinite set of weather conditions all at once.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-vs-multiverse-weather.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse vs. Multiverse"                ></p><p>Source: gulfnews.com</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-Is-the-Future-of-Metaverse"><a href="#Part-3-What-Is-the-Future-of-Metaverse" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Is the Future of Metaverse?"></a>Part 3: What Is the Future of Metaverse?</h2><p>As has been noted earlier, the discourse on Metaverse has gained tremendous momentum in the past couple of years, coinciding with the outbreak of the COVID 19 pandemic. The push for digitalization of our everyday life has accumulated extra strength as it enables us to maintain physical distance with ease. Obviously, Facebook helped a great deal in popularizing the Metaverse by way of rebranding itself as Meta this year. Various other companies prioritized their embracing of the technology too including Microsoft, Epic Games, Minecraft, Roblox, and many others. Tech investors are also making a beeline for it because, as it is being noted, again and again, the processes of digitalization are not going to take a rollback.</p><p>But in the same breath observers have pointed out that the future of Metaverse is not going to be an exact extension of where the technology lies today. As some users have reported on social media, their experience in the Metaverse was cringe-worthy. Thanks to the lack of stringent regulations, the space is ripe for sexual and racial misconduct of the kind that violates our cherished values.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-future.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse Future"                ></p><p>Privacy is another issue that tech giants have to work on to assure users that their data is protected and is not being used by any entities whatsoever in an untoward way. Success on this matter stands on the highly volatile ground as a sense of loss of individual privacy at the hands of tech outfits is gaining wide currency. Despite the fact that millennials are turning away from social media in increasing numbers, as has been noted by a number of studies, one has to understand that such a blanket rejection comes at a great cost, one which the majority of people cannot possibly afford. As the future of work is now being predicted to rely heavily on Metaverse, one can possibly see why this is so. Thus the discourse turns again to the importance of regulation.</p><p>Two other frontiers that proponents of Metaverse must tackle are issues like the digital divide and environmental damage. Both these issues were resuscitated, again, thanks to the COVID 19 pandemic. Whereas the stakes are high in all these cases, this is not to say that the battle ends here. The perceived marriage between the technology of Metaverse and work, in general, has put on-table issues like class divide, racial discrimination, workplace exploitation, inept tax laws, and many things else.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>In conclusion, it is honest to admit that the future of Metaverse is still a highly speculative zone. The technology is new and packs immense potentialities in a number of different aspects. And this same inchoateness gives rise to apprehension along with a call for the tighter harnessing of the technology. Multiverse, on the other hand, is still mostly an erudite hypothetical concept, unlike Metaverse whose early renditions are already here for us to experience.</p><p>Hope lies in the fact that the formation of the Metaverse vs. Multiverse discourse has helped in clarifying the latter concept. Pop culture renditions, the kind we find in the latest Spiderman offering, Spiderman: No Way Home, or in the widely-acclaimed Richard Linklater film Slacker are also contributing in that direction. With the breath-taking pace that technology is evolving, one can be optimistic that both these concepts will move beyond this conflictual relationship and open themselves up to us to enjoy them on their own terms.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>There is no denying the fact that the lure of an embodied virtual existence has monopolized our imagination in recent years like never before.

Time and space as the two biggest constraints defining our reality thus vanish here.</p><h2 id="Part-2-A-Comprehensive-Comparison-between-Metaverse-and-Multiverse-3"><a href="#Part-2-A-Comprehensive-Comparison-between-Metaverse-and-Multiverse-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: A Comprehensive Comparison between Metaverse and Multiverse"></a>Part 2: A Comprehensive Comparison between Metaverse and Multiverse</h2><p>Now that the basic ideas behind these two words are dealt with, it is fairly easy to delineate the differences that keep alive the Metaverse vs. Multiverse debate.</p><h3 id="1-Number-of-Universes-3"><a href="#1-Number-of-Universes-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Number of Universes"></a>1. Number of Universes</h3><p>One of the very basic features that underline the Metaverse vs. Multiverse debate is this one. Whereas Metaverse denotes only one universe, a Multiverse is a collection of an unending number of metaverses functioning side by side.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-vs-multiverse-number.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse vs. Multiverse"                ></p><p>Source: techrepublic.com</p><h3 id="2-Order-3"><a href="#2-Order-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Order"></a>2. Order</h3><p>Another big factor that distances a Metaverse from a Multiverse is that the former surrenders to the laws of Time and Space and so events and objects here are orderly, unlike a Multiverse. In a Metaverse then, events follow each other in a timely fashion just as two different places don’t overlap at any given time. In a Multiverse, because it is beyond time and space, witnessing randomness is pretty common.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-vs-multiverse-order.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse vs. Multiverse"                ></p><p>Source: themetaversereviewer.com</p><h3 id="3-Entities-3"><a href="#3-Entities-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Entities"></a>3. Entities</h3><p>A Metaverse is a virtual space populated by entities like virtual doppelgangers of human users, Artificial Intelligence, virtual objects, etc. whereas theoretically, a Multiverse is bereft of all these. It is when one jumps from one Metaverse to the other within a Multiverse does one finds all these specificities.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-vs-multiverse-entities.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse vs. Multiverse"                ></p><h3 id="4-Weather-Condition-3"><a href="#4-Weather-Condition-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Weather Condition"></a>4. Weather Condition</h3><p>This is another factor that features in the arc of Metaverse vs. Multiverse narrative. Metaverse, being a replication of this real-world, has its specific weather conditions that users can manipulate nonetheless. But a Multiverse features an infinite set of weather conditions all at once.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-vs-multiverse-weather.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse vs. Multiverse"                ></p><p>Source: gulfnews.com</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-Is-the-Future-of-Metaverse-3"><a href="#Part-3-What-Is-the-Future-of-Metaverse-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Is the Future of Metaverse?"></a>Part 3: What Is the Future of Metaverse?</h2><p>As has been noted earlier, the discourse on Metaverse has gained tremendous momentum in the past couple of years, coinciding with the outbreak of the COVID 19 pandemic. The push for digitalization of our everyday life has accumulated extra strength as it enables us to maintain physical distance with ease. Obviously, Facebook helped a great deal in popularizing the Metaverse by way of rebranding itself as Meta this year. Various other companies prioritized their embracing of the technology too including Microsoft, Epic Games, Minecraft, Roblox, and many others. Tech investors are also making a beeline for it because, as it is being noted, again and again, the processes of digitalization are not going to take a rollback.</p><p>But in the same breath observers have pointed out that the future of Metaverse is not going to be an exact extension of where the technology lies today. As some users have reported on social media, their experience in the Metaverse was cringe-worthy. Thanks to the lack of stringent regulations, the space is ripe for sexual and racial misconduct of the kind that violates our cherished values.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/metaverse-future.jpg"                      alt="Metaverse Future"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123477/16836" target="_top" id="2123477">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2123477" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123477/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Privacy is another issue that tech giants have to work on to assure users that their data is protected and is not being used by any entities whatsoever in an untoward way. Success on this matter stands on the highly volatile ground as a sense of loss of individual privacy at the hands of tech outfits is gaining wide currency. Despite the fact that millennials are turning away from social media in increasing numbers, as has been noted by a number of studies, one has to understand that such a blanket rejection comes at a great cost, one which the majority of people cannot possibly afford. As the future of work is now being predicted to rely heavily on Metaverse, one can possibly see why this is so. Thus the discourse turns again to the importance of regulation.</p><p>Two other frontiers that proponents of Metaverse must tackle are issues like the digital divide and environmental damage. Both these issues were resuscitated, again, thanks to the COVID 19 pandemic. Whereas the stakes are high in all these cases, this is not to say that the battle ends here. The perceived marriage between the technology of Metaverse and work, in general, has put on-table issues like class divide, racial discrimination, workplace exploitation, inept tax laws, and many things else.</p><h3 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>In conclusion, it is honest to admit that the future of Metaverse is still a highly speculative zone. The technology is new and packs immense potentialities in a number of different aspects. And this same inchoateness gives rise to apprehension along with a call for the tighter harnessing of the technology. Multiverse, on the other hand, is still mostly an erudite hypothetical concept, unlike Metaverse whose early renditions are already here for us to experience.</p><p>Hope lies in the fact that the formation of the Metaverse vs. Multiverse discourse has helped in clarifying the latter concept. Pop culture renditions, the kind we find in the latest Spiderman offering, Spiderman: No Way Home, or in the widely-acclaimed Richard Linklater film Slacker are also contributing in that direction. With the breath-taking pace that technology is evolving, one can be optimistic that both these concepts will move beyond this conflictual relationship and open themselves up to us to enjoy them on their own terms.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/new-cutting-edge-videography-top-cameras-for-2024/"><u>[New] Cutting-Edge Videography Top Cameras for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/updated-a-deep-dive-into-previewed-fb-interactions-necessity-or-risk/"><u>[Updated] A Deep Dive Into Previewed FB Interactions Necessity or Risk?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-edit-your-way-to-success-iosandroid-apps-for-youtube-shorts/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Edit Your Way to Success IOS/Android Apps for YouTube Shorts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/achieving-proficiency-comprehensive-photoshop-hdr-tutorial/"><u>Achieving Proficiency Comprehensive Photoshop HDR Tutorial</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/client-visionaries-shaping-brand-narratives-through-video/"><u>Client Visionaries Shaping Brand Narratives Through Video</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/in-2024-core-understanding-of-narrative-frameworks/"><u>In 2024, Core Understanding of Narrative Frameworks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/oneplus-ace-3-stuck-on-screen-finding-solutions-for-stuck-on-boot-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>OnePlus Ace 3 Stuck on Screen – Finding Solutions For Stuck on Boot | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/seamless-transition-turning-srt-into-sub/"><u>Seamless Transition Turning SRT Into SUB</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/unlocking-flawless-youtube-twitplay-for-2024/"><u>Unlocking Flawless YouTube Twitplay for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

It’s a Mini PC in the form of an official Dev Kit, which undercuts (<a class="link"   href="https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8900246-12578053?sid=tomshardware-us-1069194734322795598&url=https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-computer-laptops/new-inspiron-14-plus-laptop/spd/inspiron-14-7441-laptop/useichbts7441hcjp?ref=variantstack" >or at least matches <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) the price of even the lower-end Snapdragon X Plus laptops, and it’s set for a full launch on August 23rd, though it’s also already available for pre-order on<a class="link"   href="https://www.arrow.com/en/products/c8380-12c-mp-32g/thundercomm" >Arrow.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for just $899 USD.</p><p> We just reviewed a Snapdragon X Elite laptop— the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/laptops/ultrabooks-ultraportables/dell-xps-13-9345-review" >Dell XPS 13 9345 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> — and that unit retails for $1299, which is about $400 pricier for the laptop form factor.</p><h2 id="Qualcomm-Snapdragon-Dev-Kit-for-Windows-Specifications"><a href="#Qualcomm-Snapdragon-Dev-Kit-for-Windows-Specifications" class="headerlink" title="Qualcomm Snapdragon Dev Kit for Windows Specifications"></a>Qualcomm Snapdragon Dev Kit for Windows Specifications</h2><ul><li><strong>SoC</strong> : Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite X-1E-00-1DE, specs divided between CPU, GPU, and NPU below</li><li><strong>CPU</strong> : Qualcomm Oryon CPU with 12 cores rated at up to 3.8 GHz, or 4.3 with Dual Core Boost; 42 MB cache</li><li><strong>GPU</strong> : Qualcomm Adreno GPU rated for 4.6 Teraflops</li><li><strong>NPU</strong> : Qualcomm Hexagon NPU rated for 45 TOPS</li><li><strong>RAM</strong> : 32GB LPDDR5X RAM</li><li><strong>Storage</strong> : 512 GB “Fast” NVMe SSD</li><li><strong>OS</strong> : Windows 11</li><li><strong>Size</strong> : 199 mm x 175 mm x 35 mm, or 8 x 7 x 1.3 inches</li><li><strong>Weight</strong> : 970 grams, or ~2.1 lbs</li><li><strong>I&#x2F;O</strong> : 3 USB4 Type-C ports (1 Front), 2 USB 3.2 Type-A ports; 1 Ethernet port; 1 HDMI port; 1 3.5mm audio port</li></ul><p> So, who is this Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite Mini PC really for? As advertised, it’s targeted at developers, which makes sense— if you’re hoping to target ARM-native software for the X Elite chips hitting the laptop or want to properly test and tweak your x86-native software for use with those devices, this seems like the way to go. But if the enhanced AI features (<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/live/copilot-pc-launch-2024" >Copilot+ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) of the Snapdragon X Elite happen to hold particularly high appeal to you and your workflows, that’s another reason this piece of kit could be compelling.</p><p> For gaming purposes, we definitely wouldn’t recommend the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite platform at this time. While it’s true that some games work and even the new image scaling options added just for Windows ARM and these devices are compelling, the overall gaming performance and compatibility of Snapdragon X Elite just isn’t competitive with x86 gaming laptops at this time. Other iGPUs—<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/pc-gaming/qualcomm-snapdragon-x-elite-laptops-suffer-compatibility-issues-with-many-games#xenforo-comments-3848147" >even_Intel_ iGPUs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> — provide a much better experience.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> But it’s not all doom and gloom in the world of Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite laptops — or Mini PCs in this case — as long as you have the requisite monitor and peripherals to get it up and running. You generally have a pretty usable version of<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/windows-11" >Windows 11 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> here, and a number of productivity and creative applications that will work perfectly fine.

Also, PowerPoint presentation on a windows device is similar to a Mac. However, some control and key functions differ in the two devices. The only thing you should note when you want to use the speech-to-text function is the type of device you are using. You can enable “speech-to-text” on devices like Mac, Windows, and mobile phones.</p><p>Please note that “enabling speech-to-text” in PowerPoint differs from “using speech-to-text.” For example, you have to enable the speech-to-text first before you can use it. Also, how you enable speech-to-text in PowerPoint is based on the selected devices. Let’s discuss enabling speech-to-text on Mac and Windows.</p><h3 id="Enable-speech-to-text-on-Mac"><a href="#Enable-speech-to-text-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Enable speech-to-text on Mac"></a><strong>Enable speech-to-text on Mac</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Select the control button:</strong> Mac allows you to select the control button for activating speech-to-text the first time you want to use the feature. Unlike other devices, the control option pops up when you select the speech-to-text option. It then displays some control options so that you can select the button suitable for you.</li><li><strong>Activate the feature:</strong> click on the apple logo on your Mac, and select <strong>“system preference.”</strong> Select <strong>“keyboard”</strong> options displayed in the system preference.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/can-you-do-speech-to-text-in-powerpoint-1.jpg"                      alt="click on the apple logo"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Select the dictation option:</strong> select dictation from the keyboard option and check the <strong>“on&#x2F;off”</strong> The option also has an advanced feature that allows additional commands.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/can-you-do-speech-to-text-in-powerpoint-2.jpg"                      alt="select the dictation option"                ></p><p>Once you activate the dictation from the command button, you can use the speech-to-text feature anywhere you can type on Mac - this applies to PowerPoint. However, you may need some tweaking on PowerPoint to finally use the feature as you prepare your slides.</p><h3 id="Enable-speech-to-text-on-Windows"><a href="#Enable-speech-to-text-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Enable speech-to-text on Windows"></a><strong>Enable speech-to-text on Windows</strong></h3><p>Aside from the regular Cortana speech recognition on Windows, you can use the speech-to-text feature on PowerPoint. PowerPoint supports “speech-to-text” when you use the program; however, activating the Windows device through the <strong>built-in speech recognition</strong> makes the process easy and effective. Some windows PC, just like Mac, lets you first activate the speech recognition function before you proceed and use it on PowerPoint.</p><ul><li>On PowerPoint, click on the microphone icon on the left corner of your PowerPoint’s homepage. If the speech-to-text feature is not activated on your device, you can follow the instruction to activate it. Peradventure you do not have PowerPoint installed on your device, you can activate the dictation feature through the command button or search feature on windows.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/can-you-do-speech-to-text-in-powerpoint-3.jpg"                      alt="click on the microphone icon"                ></p><ul><li>Click on the search button and type <strong>“dictation”</strong> or “<strong>speech services</strong>,” and the device redirects you to settings.

You can select the real-time option on your PowerPoint and makes it display another subtitle in other languages. Thus, when you speak in a language, the captions or subtitles display another text (speech-to-text) in a different language.</p><ul><li>Click on the <strong>slide show</strong>, and go to <strong>subtitle settings</strong>; select <strong>spoken languages.</strong> The spoken language is the “speech input language”: the language you will speak to be translated.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/can-you-do-speech-to-text-in-powerpoint-8.jpg"                      alt="click on the slide show"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137413/7443" target="_top" id="2137413">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137413" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137413/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li>After setting the spoken language, move on to set the <strong>subtitle&#x2F;caption language.</strong> The subtitle or caption language is the translated language. PowerPoint allows you to translate speech without using an application. You can make a multi-language selection without much involvement - just settings.</li></ul><p><strong>Tips:</strong> Many options are available for easy use and accessibility. Aside from the multi-language selection, you can explore the “slide show” settings for better understanding. You may see other options that best illustrate your need for translation in real-time on PowerPoint.</p><p>When you activate the real-time translation on PowerPoint, the settings occur in two stages: slideshow view and presenter view. You can vary the changes based on your view (as the presenter) or what people see (slideshow view).</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-make-speech-to-text-and-translation-to-create-PowerPoint-videos"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-make-speech-to-text-and-translation-to-create-PowerPoint-videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to make speech-to-text and translation to create PowerPoint videos"></a>Part 4: How to make speech-to-text and translation to create PowerPoint videos</h2><p>When you want to make perfect PPT videos, you can use Filmora’s STT feature. Wondershare Filmora Speech to Text is quite different with other STT service providers. Other STT platforms&#x2F;stages require you to use the application to convert speech-to-text, save, and export into other third-party software. However, Wondershare Filmora allows you to directly convert your speech-to-text on an ongoing production.

Achieving this goal is impossible without spending thousands of hours practicing and polishing your skills. Drawing apps for Android OS enable you to keep practicing your drawing and painting skills whenever you have some free time.</p><p>Google Play hosts hundreds of apps that offer at least some drawing and painting features, which can make the search for a drawing app that meets all your needs a total nightmare. That’s the reason why we selected the top ten drawing apps for Android that will enable you to unleash your creativity and turn any idea you have into a beautiful picture you’ll be proud to share with your friends.</p><h2 id="10-Best-Free-and-Paid-Drawing-Apps-for-Android-OS"><a href="#10-Best-Free-and-Paid-Drawing-Apps-for-Android-OS" class="headerlink" title="10 Best Free and Paid Drawing Apps for Android OS"></a>10 Best Free and Paid Drawing Apps for Android OS</h2><p>We’ve shortlisted ten drawing apps you can use for anything from casual doodling to creating highly detailed hyper-realistic digital paintings. However, their capabilities and the range of drawing and painting tools they offer varies, which enables you to choose the one that is best suited for your artistic needs. Let’s take a look at what best free and paid drawing apps for Android OS have to offer.</p><h3 id="1-ArtRage"><a href="#1-ArtRage" class="headerlink" title="1. ArtRage"></a>1. <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ambientdesign.artrage.playstore&hl=en" >ArtRage <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> $4.99</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/artrage-draw-paint-create-app.jpg"                      alt=" ArtRage Drawing App"                ></p><p>The versatile set of painting and drawing tools ArtRage app offers includes an Airbrush, a Paint Tube, or Oil Brush among others. There is a variety of settings for each tool that can be easily adjusted to the needs of your project. So, you can use paint thinner to make the paint less thick or increase and decrease the softness of a pencil tip.</p><p>Besides the color, each of these drawing and painting tools also adds texture to your images. In addition, ArtRage lets you create as many layers as you want and it grants you access to a broad spectrum of blending options so that you can stack multiple layers on top of each other. All images you create with this drawing app can be exported in JPEG and PNG formats.</p><h3 id="2-Autodesk-SketchBook"><a href="#2-Autodesk-SketchBook" class="headerlink" title="2.

Although the app’s interface is minimalistic, you can still access all tools quickly or activate perspective guides.</p><p>There are more than a hundred brushes to choose from, and the app also allows you to create and save new brushes. Moreover, you can scan your hand-drawn sketches with your device and continue working on them in Autodesk SkecthBook. There are no limitations in terms of the number of layers you can add to an image and you can quickly switch between different blend modes. The app crashes often and you may face lagging issues if you choose to install Autodesk SketchBook on your Android device.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2121331/18498" target="_top" id="2121331">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2121331" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2121331/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Adobe-Illustrator-Draw"><a href="#3-Adobe-Illustrator-Draw" class="headerlink" title="3.

In addition, the app features a rich selection of predesigned backgrounds that make the process of creating a cartoon much easier. The only downside is that MediBang contains ads which can slow down your workflow.</p><h3 id="5-dotpict"><a href="#5-dotpict" class="headerlink" title="5. dotpict"></a>5. <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dotpicko.dotpict&hl=en" >dotpict <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, but offers in-app purchases</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dotpicko-drawing-app.jpg"                      alt=" dotpict Draw App"                ></p><p>Digital artists in need of an app that lets them create pixel art are going to love using dotpict. The app lets you switch between different colors of pens which speeds up your drawing process.</p><p>The app’s features enable you to undo or redo any action you take, zoom in on the canvas, switch the grid off and on, and save or share your images. Unfortunately, dotpic doesn’t have much more to offer other than these features, so you can’t use it to create complex multi-layered designs. Even so, it is a great drawing app for novice users who are just entering the world of digital art. In addition, you must make in-app purchases in order to be able to use all of the app’s features.</p><h3 id="6-ibis-Paint-X"><a href="#6-ibis-Paint-X" class="headerlink" title="6. ibis Paint X"></a>6. <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.ne.ibis.ibispaintx.app&hl=en" >ibis Paint X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, but offers in-app purchases</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ibispaintx-drawing-app.jpg"                      alt=" ibis Paint  X Draw App"                ></p><p>With more than 80 million downloads ibis Paint X is easily one of the best drawing apps on Google Play.
