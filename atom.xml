Most video editors apply video effects to their artwork for different purposes. Nowadays, videos without effects will probably cause a decrease in audience and supporters. To prevent that, editors keep seeking the best video effects for their videos.</p><p>There are many sources of video effects. Some are included in the video editing software, and you can find some on the internet. There are also video effects that can give a more realistic effect, which is probably a premium one, and you need to spend money to get that video effect in your hands. But if you don’t want to spend money seeking video effects, this article will significantly help you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/free-video-effects.jpg"                      alt="free video effects"                ></p><p>This composition will give you some information on how you will be able to download video effects without spending money.</p><ol><li><a href="#part1-1">How does VFX differ from SFX?</a></li><li><a href="#part1-2">When to use SFX</a></li><li><a href="#part1-3">When to use VFX</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part2">How to Get Free Video Effects?</a></li></ul><ol><li><a href="#part2-1">Pixabay.com</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-2">Pexels.com</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-3">Mixkit.co</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-4">Videezy.com</a>  </li><li><a href="#part2-5">Videvo.net</a></li></ol><h2 id="What-are-Video-Effects"><a href="#What-are-Video-Effects" class="headerlink" title="What are Video Effects?"></a>What are Video Effects?</h2><p>The acronym VFX stands for video effects.

The resources utilized to express a story and convey a message include films, photography, animation, and music. These stories may distribute more widely and swiftly than ever through online platforms like webpages, journals, and social media sharing sites.</p><p><strong><em>“Simply put, it is telling stories with digital technologies. Digital stories are narratives built from the stuff of cyberculture.”</em></strong> <a class="link"   href="https://www.ala.org/acrl/publications/keeping%5Fup%5Fwith/storytelling#:~:text=It%20involves%20creating%20and%20sharing,telling%20stories%20with%20digital%20technologies." >-Bryan Alexander. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>Additionally, digital storytelling can include a variety of digital narratives. A rising number of businesses are taking note and investigating the potential applications of a digital story. It is frequently employed to refer to filmmaking in general, and it has recently been used to describe commercial and non-profit advertising and promotion efforts.</p><h2 id="Part-II-Development-of-Digital-Storytelling"><a href="#Part-II-Development-of-Digital-Storytelling" class="headerlink" title="Part II. Development of Digital Storytelling"></a>Part II. Development of Digital Storytelling</h2><p>Dana Atchley and Joe Lambert of the Center for Digital Storytelling started the digital storytelling advancement in 1994 by teaching others how to create digital stories. Although the power of storytelling has existed for thousands of years, it has only recently become possible for storytellers to <strong>“become digital”</strong> because of the advancement of personal computers and friendly modern communications.</p><p>High goals and outdated technologies coexisted throughout this period. Browsers were quite straightforward at the time, and dial-up remained still in use. There were no devices for accessing the internet, and most individuals read the digital narrative on their desktop computers.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/tools-and-tips-virtual-storytelling-2.jpg"                      alt="tools and tips for virtual storytelling"                ></p><p>In this regard, the Center for Digital Storytelling developed a digital story that emphasized first-person narratives that framed memories as potent stories using visuals, audio, and music.

TikTok is based in Beijing, China, and was launched in September 2016.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/tiktok-app.jpg"                      alt="tiktok app"                ></p><p>It’s great for promoting your business with short, engaging videos. You can use TikTok to show off your products, give behind-the-scenes looks at your business, or even just tell your brand story. You can also use TikTok to run ads.</p><h2 id="Facebook"><a href="#Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Facebook"></a>Facebook</h2><p>Facebook currently has 1.908 billion daily active users, giving it a huge audience to reach customers. Facebook also has a lot of information about its users, which means they can target their ads more effectively than other platforms.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/facebook-app.jpg"                      alt="facebook app"                ></p><p>Facebook’s advertising options are extensive and include Pros and Cons:</p><p>Advantages include being able to show your product at different stages in its lifecycle (e.g., pre-order vs. purchase); being able to target what kind of consumer you want; and having access to analytics that allow you to see how well your ads are performing (i.e., number of clicks&#x2F;impression).</p><p>Disadvantages include not knowing if people are going directly from clicking on an ad and buying something else online instead; not being able to tell if someone who saw an ad might have come back later to buy something from you instead, or spending too much money on ads without seeing results immediately (the latter is one reason why some businesses don’t like using Facebook as much).</p><h2 id="Twitter"><a href="#Twitter" class="headerlink" title="Twitter"></a>Twitter</h2><p>Twitter, the platform that started off as a way for people to share their thoughts up to 280 characters or less, has become much more than that. It is a great way to communicate with your customers and it can also help make your brand stand out. Twitter allows you to engage with potential customers and get feedback from them about what they think of your product or service.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/twitter-app.jpg"                      alt="twitter app"                ></p><p>If you want customer service feedback in real-time then Twitter is probably one of the best ways to do it because users are always on their phones looking at social media throughout the day. Also, Twitter is one of the easiest platforms to use so if someone needs help they can easily get it by tweeting someone who works there directly.</p><h2 id="YouTube"><a href="#YouTube" class="headerlink" title="YouTube"></a>YouTube</h2><p>There are plenty of reasons why YouTube is a great platform for business. Here are some of them:</p><p>You can create and share content. If you want to start sharing your knowledge with the world, then this is a good place to start. The only thing you need is a camera and an internet connection!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/youtube-app.jpg"                      alt="youtube app"                ></p><p>It’s a great place to connect with people who have similar interests as you do, or even just connect with people in general (if what they’re interested in has something to do with your field).</p><p>You can learn things too! There are tons of tutorials available on YouTube that will teach any skill imaginable - everything from learning how to play guitar or speak Spanish, all the way up through creating entire websites from scratch (which may be more than some people want). If there’s something specific that interests me personally then I know I’ll probably find it there somewhere because there are millions upon millions of videos uploaded every day by millions upon millions of different people worldwide.”</p><h2 id="Instagram"><a href="#Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Instagram"></a>Instagram</h2><p>Instagram is a visual platform, so it’s no surprise that it’s one of the best social media platforms for business. Not only can you use Instagram to promote your brand and products, but it also allows you to build customer engagement and build a community around your brand.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/instagram-app.jpg"                      alt="instagram app"                ></p><p>Instagram also has the advantage of being owned by Facebook, which means that you can easily transfer followers from Instagram onto Facebook.</p><h2 id="LinkedIn"><a href="#LinkedIn" class="headerlink" title="LinkedIn"></a>LinkedIn</h2><p>LinkedIn is a social media platform that is designed for business networking. It can be used to find customers, connect with industry thought leaders, and build relationships with other businesses.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/linkedin-app.jpg"                      alt="linkedin app"                ></p><p>LinkedIn is also a great place to post content, whether it’s articles, videos, or infographics. This is because LinkedIn users are generally more engaged than users of other social media platforms, and they’re more likely to read and share content that is interesting and relevant to their industry.</p><p>One disadvantage of LinkedIn is that it can be difficult to stand out from the crowd if you’re not a large or well-known company. This is because there are already so many businesses on LinkedIn, and many of them are already well-established.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>So, what’s the best social media platform for your business? I think the answer is different for everyone. The important thing is that you find out where your customers are and how they use social media. Then, you can join them on their favorite platforms and connect with them there.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-accelerating-your-creative-process-with-mac-dvd-authoring/"><u>2024 Approved  Accelerating Your Creative Process with Mac DVD Authoring</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/transferring-tactics-swiftly-send-files-to-devices/"><u>Transferring Tactics  Swiftly Send Files to Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/in-2024-blurry-photos-top-tools-reviewed/"><u>In 2024, Blurry Photos  Top Tools Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/number-1-in-the-8th-digital-image-blend-platform/"><u>Number 1 in the 8Th Digital Image Blend Platform</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/new-brightening-indoor-realms-naturally-and-smartly/"><u>[New] Brightening Indoor Realms Naturally and Smartly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/new-collage-alchemy-transforming-scraps-into-art/"><u>[New] Collage Alchemy  Transforming Scraps Into Art</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/updated-best-5-professional-drones-you-can-buy/"><u>[Updated] Best 5 Professional Drones You Can Buy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/in-2024-capture-cinematic-motion-smear-in-adobe/"><u>In 2024, Capture Cinematic Motion Smear in Adobe</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/new-chart-topping-stock-photos-and-their-narratives/"><u>[New] Chart-Topping Stock Photos and Their Narratives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/earn-while-you-entertain-the-content-creators-guide-for-2024/"><u>Earn While You Entertain  The Content Creator's Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/streamline-your-browsing-with-these-7-android-centric-adblockers-for-2024/"><u>Streamline Your Browsing with These 7 Android-Centric AdBlockers for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/updated-mastering-youtube-audio-a-step-by-step-download-guide-for-2024/"><u>Updated Mastering YouTube Audio A Step-by-Step Download Guide for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/ultimate-vote-players-best-political-game-reviews-for-2024/"><u>Ultimate Vote-Players  Best Political Game Reviews for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-show-wi-fi-password-on-oppo-a38-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Show Wi-Fi Password on Oppo A38</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/in-2024-smirkscribbler-visual-laughter-hub/"><u>In 2024, SmirkScribbler  Visual Laughter Hub</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-elevating-your-video-with-expert-gopro-studio-techniques/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Elevating Your Video with Expert GoPro Studio Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-discover-easy-fb-ad-videos-free-creation-kit-available-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Discover Easy FB Ad Videos – FREE Creation Kit Available for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/kindred-spirits-nintendos-best-android-emulators-for-2024/"><u>Kindred Spirits  Nintendo's Best Android Emulators for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlocking-an-icloud-locked-ipad-and-apple-iphone-15-pro-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Unlocking an iCloud Locked iPad and Apple iPhone 15 Pro</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Additionally, you will discover three simple ways of photoshop color grading that you can use, regardless of your skill level.

Well, the answer is yes, and here is how they differ.</p><h3 id="Color-Grading"><a href="#Color-Grading" class="headerlink" title="Color Grading"></a>Color Grading</h3><p>Color grading photoshop refers to the final process of content creation. It involves subtle tweaks to your photos to make them more stylish. Some of your reasons may include:</p><ul><li>Adjusting contrast so that you do not hurt your viewers’ eyes.</li><li>Color balancing</li><li>White balancing</li><li>Black leveling</li><li>Luminance adjustments</li><li>Color saturation.</li><li>Saturation</li><li>Hue</li><li>Effects and so on</li></ul><p>For example, tweaking your Instagram photo with a retro color scheme is color grading. You can achieve this by using photoshop cinematic color grading.</p><h3 id="Color-Correction"><a href="#Color-Correction" class="headerlink" title="Color Correction"></a>Color Correction</h3><p>Color correction refers to the fixes you make when creating your content. It focuses on making changes relevant to your target audience. You can do this during production from the device. For example, you can adjust your camera’s exposure when shooting your stills. As such, they appear more natural and unprocessed.</p><p>Additionally, you can do this in post-production, as the first step of your color grading photoshop process.</p><p>Some of the fixes you can do for color correction include:</p><ul><li>Eliminating dark spots and red eyes.</li><li>Changing the resolution to fit specific content. For example, you can adjust your photo to a 600 X 300 resolution to put it in a blog post.</li><li>Alternatively, you can color correct photos from different cameras to maintain consistency. Typically, you do this is for related content.</li><li>Finally, the vacation photos you want to share also include your ex. You can color correct them by cropping the section that has you and them.</li></ul><p>Now that you know the difference, why should you do them for your photos?</p><p>Both processes are essential to creating quality content and vary among creators. Some of the reasons include:</p><ul><li>You want to create a unique style that will make your content instantly recognizable. For example, you will immediately recognize a Quentin Tarantino movie thanks to the emphasis on red in his action scenes. Another example is Tyler Perry. He prefers brighter than usual color schemes.</li><li>Alternatively, you use color grading and color correction to create variation in scenes. For example, you can indicate a throwback photo by making it black and white.</li><li>Additionally, color grading photoshop is an excellent way to elicit different moods. For example, a color scheme that features bright yellows, greens, or blues can indicate different excitement levels.</li><li>Furthermore, you use color correction and color grading to indicate the importance of some scene sections. For example, news briefs are usually brighter than the rest of the shot, especially when displaying important messages, such as breaking news.</li><li>Finally, you do photoshop cinematic color grading to ensure consistency in your photos. Weather is unpredictable and can cause your scenes to vary dramatically. For example, some sections of your location may not receive similar lighting. As such, you can make those sections brighter through color grading in photoshop.</li></ul><h2 id="3-Simple-Ways-to-Color-Grading-in-Photoshop"><a href="#3-Simple-Ways-to-Color-Grading-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="3 Simple Ways to Color Grading in Photoshop"></a>3 Simple Ways to Color Grading in Photoshop</h2><p>Below are 3 simple ways to color grade in Photoshop.</p><h3 id="1-Using-Photo-Filter"><a href="#1-Using-Photo-Filter" class="headerlink" title="1.

Typically, you do this is for related content.</li><li>Finally, the vacation photos you want to share also include your ex. You can color correct them by cropping the section that has you and them.</li></ul><p>Now that you know the difference, why should you do them for your photos?</p><p>Both processes are essential to creating quality content and vary among creators. Some of the reasons include:</p><ul><li>You want to create a unique style that will make your content instantly recognizable. For example, you will immediately recognize a Quentin Tarantino movie thanks to the emphasis on red in his action scenes. Another example is Tyler Perry.

For example, you can indicate a throwback photo by making it black and white.</li><li>Additionally, color grading photoshop is an excellent way to elicit different moods. For example, a color scheme that features bright yellows, greens, or blues can indicate different excitement levels.</li><li>Furthermore, you use color correction and color grading to indicate the importance of some scene sections. For example, news briefs are usually brighter than the rest of the shot, especially when displaying important messages, such as breaking news.</li><li>Finally, you do photoshop cinematic color grading to ensure consistency in your photos. Weather is unpredictable and can cause your scenes to vary dramatically. For example, some sections of your location may not receive similar lighting.

Top 10 Meme Template Ideas<p>Social media doesn’t have to be just serious and instructive. You may also enjoy it a little bit! Adding comedy or relevant material is really a terrific strategy to engage your readers. The decade’s biggest cultural phenomena are memes. Every human phenomenon has a meme equivalent, but certain forms have shown to be more effective and durable over time than others, both in terms of narrative flexibility and the opportunity for innovative remixes. We’ve picked the top 10 meme templates below.</p><h3 id="1-Burning-Paper-1"><a href="#1-Burning-Paper-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Burning Paper"></a>1. Burning Paper</h3><p>A year without a new SpongeBob meme is nothing. In this meme, SpongeBob may be seen reading a document with some mockery before burning it without looking back. This sample only demonstrates the lack of interest some individuals have in anything.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/burning-paper.jpg"                      alt="burning paper"                ></p><h3 id="2-They-Can’t-Read-1"><a href="#2-They-Can’t-Read-1" class="headerlink" title="2. They Can’t Read"></a>2. They Can’t Read</h3><p>What more effective approach to convey a point than via a meme? Using this template, you may express a strong or unpopular stance while simultaneously making snide remarks about others who disagree with you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/they-cant-read.jpg"                      alt="they cant read"                ></p><h3 id="3-I-Am-Once-Again-Asking-1"><a href="#3-I-Am-Once-Again-Asking-1" class="headerlink" title="3. I Am Once Again Asking"></a>3. I Am Once Again Asking</h3><p>This priceless meme was lifted from one of Bernie Sanders’ campaign materials. This example just demonstrates how desperate people would do anything, no matter how humiliating. And we apologize to Bernie personally for our shortcomings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/im-once-again-asking.jpg"                      alt="im once again asking"                ></p><h3 id="4-Draw-25-1"><a href="#4-Draw-25-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Draw 25"></a>4. Draw 25</h3><p>You know that feeling you get in the game of Uno when you just have one card and simply can’t seem to obtain the card you need, so you keep drawing? This example only demonstrates the fact that certain choices aren’t worthwhile at any price.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/draw-25.jpg"                      alt="draw 25"                ></p><h3 id="5-I-Pretend-I-Do-Not-See-It-1"><a href="#5-I-Pretend-I-Do-Not-See-It-1" class="headerlink" title="5. I Pretend I Do Not See It"></a>5. I Pretend I Do Not See It</h3><p>I Pretend I Do Not See It is another one on the list. There are times when we just do not want to see things, especially when they are complete and total disappointments, like the year 2020. We have elected to become blind because we are too exhausted, and I believe I can speak for everyone when I say that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/pretend-dont-see-it.jpg"                      alt="pretend dont see it"                ></p><h3 id="6-Gossip-Girl-1"><a href="#6-Gossip-Girl-1" class="headerlink" title="6. Gossip Girl"></a>6. Gossip Girl</h3><p>This Gossip Girl-inspired meme template combines some intriguing questions with the show’s logo’s writing to create a humorous whole. This meme style consistently entertains, regardless of whether the comedy is in the question or the answer.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/gossip-girl.jpg"                      alt="gossip girl"                ></p><h3 id="7-Return-To-Monke-1"><a href="#7-Return-To-Monke-1" class="headerlink" title="7. Return To Monke"></a>7. Return To Monke</h3><p>If we were all monkeys, this epidemic would not have occurred. Absolutely, I say. Because of this, I and a vast majority of people think that we need to abandon a million years of development and go back to being monks.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/return-to-monke.jpg"                      alt="return to monke"                ></p><h3 id="8-They-Don’t-Know-1"><a href="#8-They-Don’t-Know-1" class="headerlink" title="8. They Don’t Know"></a>8. They Don’t Know</h3><p>When you’re at a party and people don’t realize how much superior you are to them, isn’t that upsetting? Everyone believes that it’s okay, and this meme is proof of that.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/they-dont-know.jpg"                      alt="they dont know"                ></p><h3 id="9-How-It-Started-1"><a href="#9-How-It-Started-1" class="headerlink" title="9. How It Started"></a>9. How It Started</h3><p>In a year when everything remained same at all times, we were certainly preoccupied with looking for signs of advancement. Unfortunately, a lot of the time it felt like things were just getting worse.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/how-it-started.jpg"                      alt="how it started"                ></p><h3 id="10-Doge-vs-Cheems-1"><a href="#10-Doge-vs-Cheems-1" class="headerlink" title="10.

Even persons with general needs such as classes, presentations, meetings, etc. would need a video editor to complete their video project. A</p><p>After Effects is one of the most promising video editing applications available in the market. It facilitates its users with many editing features. One of such major functions of After Effects is it provides different fonts and text effects to its users. Here’s a guide on <strong>how to add fonts to After Effects</strong>:</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-add-fonts-to-After-Effects"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-add-fonts-to-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How to add fonts to After Effects?"></a>Part 1. How to add fonts to After Effects?</h2><p>Adding fonts to any video editor is a crucial part because texts add a story to the video projects. They have a great impact on the cinematic quality of any video. For informative videos, the style of font decides the tone in which the texts are displayed.</p><p>Thus, selecting a proper font for the video becomes necessary in the post-production process. In the After Effects application, there are different fonts available for the users to load and use in any video. And if you are wondering <strong>how to add font in After effects</strong> to your video, then you can follow these steps:</p><ul><li>For adding the Adobe Fonts to After Effects, you will first need to enable them by signing in to the Creative Cloud application on your desktop. To do that, first, open the Creative Cloud, navigate to Assets, and click on Fonts.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/enable-fonts-adobe-after-effects.jpg"                      alt="enable fonts adobe after effects"                ></p><ul><li>This will direct you to the official website of Adobe Fonts where you can enable the fonts for your After Effects application. Once you are done with that click on the “Browse Fonts” and then in the opened tab, you will see a variety of fonts with their specified categories.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/browse-fonts-adobe.jpg"                      alt="browse fonts adobe"                ></p><ul><li>These fonts are classified according to several attributes such as weight, height, and contrast and are created by certified typographers. Once you have found any font that you like, click on the “Activate” button and the theme will be installed on your Adobe After Effects.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/activitate-all-fonts-after-effects.jpg"                      alt="activitate all fonts after effects"                ></p><ul><li>Now keep the Creative Cloud application up and running in your system and then open your After Effects application. There navigate to “Graphics” and then select “Add Fonts from Adobe Fonts”.</li><li>You can also use the font dropdown menu as a shortcut to use the fonts instantly. In Adobe After Effects interface, you can then select the “Character” panel to add or change the fonts to your videos.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-Types-of-Fonts-in-After-Effects"><a href="#Part-2-Types-of-Fonts-in-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Types of Fonts in After Effects"></a>Part 2. Types of Fonts in After Effects</h2><p>Adobe After Effects provides a ton of families of fonts that can be added and used in video projects. These fonts are available on the Create Cloud application and also on the official website of adobe. Also, these fonts are categorized according to their height, weight, contrast as well as other attributes. And each of these fonts is shown with a preview saying “Typography” which can be selected instantly.</p><p>Some of the most famous fonts such as “typewriter”, “Cursive Handwriting” and many more are categorized under their family of fonts and are very easy to access. Along with this, you can also select fonts with different character strokes and can alter their features while adding to your videos.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-use-text-effects-in-After-Effects"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-use-text-effects-in-After-Effects" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

How to use text effects in After Effects?</h2><p>Adding text effects in Adobe After Effects is very easy and you can use these effects by following these steps:</p><ul><li>First, select the project video that you want to edit. Then navigate to “effects and presets” and search for the presets of the texts that you want to edit.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/effects-and-presets-adobe.jpg"                      alt="effects and presets adobe"                ></p><ul><li>Now, add that text effect to your video by clicking on it and dragging and dropping it on your video. Then select any animation preset for your text from “Adobe Bridge”.</li><li>Then slide the keyframes to set the text effect on the section of the video where you want to add your text. You can also compose the text by clicking on it and editing it for adjusting its content, height, width, opacity, and color.</li><li>After you are done, save the project and your text effects will be added to the final video successfully.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-4-Alternative-ways-to-edit-text-fonts"><a href="#Part-4-Alternative-ways-to-edit-text-fonts" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

The device costs around $6200, and it manages to bring in a weight of around 40 pounds. At a speed of 93km&#x2F;h, it’s very fast and it can bring you a 5.2k camera. It’s definitely one of the best drones that can bring you complete aerial photography and a set of resounding features for your money. The manufacturer added multi-rotor features here and the fact that you can easily capture anything with great detail works to your advantage.</p><p> Aside from that, here you have a dual battery design which is rather distinct and you also acquire a very fast acceleration. This means you get to capture the videos you want on the spot and that on its own is rather wonderful to say the least. It’s one of the better professional drones as well, and at this price you can’t really ask for more. Is it worth it? Yes, you do get plenty of value for your money and if you are a professional film maker or photographer, you can make quite a lot of money from it.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> very easy to use and maneuver, fast, 27 minutes of flight time and 5.2k camera</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> expensive and pretty heavy</p><h4 id="2-Best-drone-for-real-estate-use-DJI-Phantom-4"><a href="#2-Best-drone-for-real-estate-use-DJI-Phantom-4" class="headerlink" title="2.

DJI Phantom 4 is offering you full 4K captures and it does a very good job with the flight time which is 28 minutes. At 8.82 pounds, it’s not very heavy and you can maneuver it with is. You can easily save time when you use it, because you can capture the interior footage you want with little to no effort. They did a very good job at bringing a 120 FPS mode. The 12 MP still photos also have a very good quality, which is really what you want to have with this model. The combination of great photos and videos made with this drone show the unique value you can receive from it, so you may want to check it out for that reason alone. Is this a resounding investment? Yes, if you do want a nice quality and great features, you will find that this model does deliver on all of that.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> 4k camera, 28 minutes of flight time, 120 FPS mode</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> It can be too noisy at times</p><h4 id="3-Best-professional-drones-for-agriculture-DJI-Agras-MG-1"><a href="#3-Best-professional-drones-for-agriculture-DJI-Agras-MG-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

You need to make sure that you study the soil and field quality, not to mention you need to assess the health and irrigation of your crops. The DJI Agras MG-1 does a very good job here because its battery lasts for around 24 minutes. It’s a heavy drone at around 8.8 kg, but then again you do have a good and reliable drone that can be monitored and used in any way you want. The liquid tank capacity has around 10 liters and you can use it for spraying as well. They added a smart mode too and the motor is very good at managing battery power. It’s one of the best and most efficient drones out there for agricultural use and the experience you get from using it is very good.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> great features for agricultural use, suitable for spraying crops, great flight time duration</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Expensive (Almost $15000), maneuverability can be better.</p><h4 id="4-Best-professional-drones-for-mapping-and-surveying-3DR-Site-Scan"><a href="#4-Best-professional-drones-for-mapping-and-surveying-3DR-Site-Scan" class="headerlink" title="4.

The price of around $12000 seems rather prohibitive, but the drone is particularly used for taking pictures and it does a very good job at that. It’s very stable and the camera comes with a stabilizer, so each one of the pictures works great and it manages to deliver an incredible value for your money because of that reason alone. You can use the captured images and footage to convert it into 3D models and contour maps if you want.</p><p> It works great for both enterprise and startup use, not to mention that its mapping features are great and to the point. You can charge it for around 1.5 hours, which is a pretty good time for a regular drone.</p><p> Also, you can outline the area that you want to survey on the map and the drone will fly itself. This is a nifty feature and one that many professional drones should start using sooner rather than later.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> You can outline the desired region and make it fly automatically, great image quality, stable and with a great performance.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong>  the price of around $12000 is rather high</p><h4 id="5-Best-drones-for-surveillance"><a href="#5-Best-drones-for-surveillance" class="headerlink" title="5.

It’s light at around 1.1kg, not to mention that it costs solely $800, so it’s not an expensive purchase either. Thanks to the 4K video and the 25 minutes of usage, you can easily capture great footage and use it without any problem in a wide variety of situations. The quality you receive is very good and the experience as a whole is a very distinct one. You should consider giving it a try because it does have all the best video capture features out there and it works really well.</p><p><strong>Pros:</strong> amazing video capture capabilities, great price, lightweight, durable battery</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> controls are a bit iffy at times</p><p> All these professional drones are great for a particular industry. If you really need this type of drone, you have to focus on each one of the individual industries and you have to focus on the value that it can deliver. Just consider checking these out and you will be rather impressed with the great experience you can receive in the end.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/beginners-vlogging-toolkit-gear-and-software/"><u>Beginner's Vlogging Toolkit  Gear and Software</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-deep-dive-into-inshots-editing-proficiency/"><u>In 2024, A Deep Dive Into InShot's Editing Proficiency</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-a-step-by-step-premiere-pro-for-softening-soundtracks/"><u>2024 Approved  A Step-by-Step Premiere Pro for Softening Soundtracks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/z2-advantage-an-intelligent-mobile-assessment/"><u>Z2 Advantage  An Intelligent Mobile Assessment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/mastering-media-on-mobile-best-phones-of-the-year/"><u>Mastering Media on Mobile  Best Phones of the Year</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/aerial-vehicles-a-taxonomy/"><u>Aerial Vehicles  A Taxonomy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/dji-aerial-units-baseline-upgraded-ultrahd-experts/"><u>DJI Aerial Units  Baseline, Upgraded, UltraHD Experts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-wacky-world-of-webinars-top-10-hilarious-tiktok-challenges/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Wacky World of Webinars  Top 10 Hilarious TikTok Challenges</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-dissecting-splitcams-stand-in-video-technology-for-2024/"><u>[New] Dissecting SplitCam's Stand in Video Technology for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-tips.techidaily.com/ed-in-2024-digital-riches-unleashed-measuring-your-success-on-youtubes-platform/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Digital Riches Unleashed  Measuring Your Success on YouTube's Platform</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/mastering-pc-sound-capture-an-audacity-guide/"><u>Mastering PC Sound Capture An Audacity Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-beats-and-rhythms-capturing-sounds-with-mac/"><u>[New] Beats & Rhythms  Capturing Sounds with Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/speedy-solutions-at-fingertips-customizing-shortcuts-for-win-11-repairs/"><u>Speedy Solutions at Fingertips: Customizing Shortcuts for Win 11 Repairs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/1716069868932-updated-in-2024-inbuilt-screen-capture-huaweis-mate-series-and-p-lineup-phones/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Inbuilt Screen Capture  Huawei's Mate Series & P Lineup Phones.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/updated-discover-best-alternatives-to-gopro-15-camera-choices/"><u>[Updated] Discover Best Alternatives to GoPro  15 Camera Choices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/5-ways-to-move-contacts-from-honor-magic-6-pro-to-iphone-131415-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-android-transfer-from-android/"><u>5 Ways to Move Contacts From Honor Magic 6 Pro to iPhone (13/14/15) | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

To the convenience of many, especially those involved with VR, it now comes with an improved workflow for editing virtual reality videos. While you will be required to use your favorite tools to stitch videos together for a 360 degree view, Adobe Premier Pro allows for the importation of such videos with an equirectangular projection that makes it possible to edit them just as you would work with any other video file.</p><p><strong>Related article:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Stitch GoPro Clips into 360 Videos &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Editing-360-degrees-videos-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Editing-360-degrees-videos-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Editing 360 degrees videos in Premiere Pro"></a>Editing 360 degrees videos in Premiere Pro</h2><p> Consider the following steps when editing 360 degree videos using Premiere Pro from Adobe-:</p><h4 id="1-Import-your-360-footage"><a href="#1-Import-your-360-footage" class="headerlink" title="1. Import your 360 footage"></a>1. Import your 360 footage</h4><p> After starting the application, the first step towards editing your videos is to import your footages into the application. Premiere Pro allows you to import equirectanglular video footages, which are just like the normal footages. To import your footages into the application, double click on the project panel or simply click Command + I.</p><h4 id="2-Adjust-your-settings"><a href="#2-Adjust-your-settings" class="headerlink" title="2. Adjust your settings"></a>2. Adjust your settings</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/360-editing-settings.jpg"                      alt="Edit 360 videos with Premiere Pro - Settings"                ></p><p> Premiere Pro allows you to view any video by double clicking on the video in the project panel. Be default, the equirectanglular video clips will appear on the preview panel, but they will be distorted. To change how the videos appear on the preview panel, it is imperative to adjust the settings. This is done by clicking on the wrench icon located at the bottom right of window then navigating to VR Video&gt;Settings. This will pull up the menu to let you adjust the various settings you need to proceed with the editing.</p><h4 id="3-Set-the-Preview-Window-to-VR-Mode"><a href="#3-Set-the-Preview-Window-to-VR-Mode" class="headerlink" title="3. Set the Preview Window to VR Mode"></a>3. Set the Preview Window to VR Mode</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/enable-vr-mode.jpg"                      alt="Edit 360 videos with Premiere Pro - Enable VR mode"                ></p><p> After you have established the right settings for your project, the next thing you need to do is to set the preview window into VR Mode. There are two ways to do this and they include-:</p><ul><li>Click the wrench icon and choose Video &gt; VR Mode or,</li><li>From the button menu, select the VR Mode button, which can also be found by selecting the “+ icon”</li></ul><p> To navigate around the preview window in the VR Mode, use the sliders along the edges of the frame or simply click and drag when you are inside the frame. You should be familiar with these settings and actions if you have had some experience with YouTube VR in the past.</p><h4 id="4-Edit-your-footage"><a href="#4-Edit-your-footage" class="headerlink" title="4. Edit your footage"></a>4. Edit your footage</h4><p> After importing your footage and adjusting the settings as well as setting the preview window into VR Mode, you are now ready to begin the actual editing of the 360 degree video in Premier Pro. In as much as VR editing sounds like a new phenomenon in video creation, it shouldn’t be viewed any differently from working with a video footage in the timeline. As long as the video footage remains equirectangular, you will be able to trim, slice and add color to the footage just as you would do when working with the normal videos. However, don’t forget that transformational effects such as warp stabilizer will not be available for your 360 video.</p><h4 id="5-Exporting-the-VR-Footage"><a href="#5-Exporting-the-VR-Footage" class="headerlink" title="5. Exporting the VR Footage"></a>5. Exporting the VR Footage</h4><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-vr-footage.jpg"                      alt="Edit 360 videos with Premiere Pro - Export VR footage"                ></p><p> A while back, exporting VR footages to YouTube was possible only through third party applications. But now, such capabilities have been included in Adobe Premiere Pro and you can now apply all the Meta data directly inside the application. To export your edited footage, navigate to File&gt;Export&gt;Media or simply hit Command + M to pop up the export window. Select your desired codecs and navigate to the video tab and ensure that you have selected the VR Video Checkbox.</p><h2 id="Best-Video-Editor-Wondershare-Filmora"><a href="#Best-Video-Editor-Wondershare-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Editor: Wondershare Filmora"></a>Best Video Editor: Wondershare Filmora</h2><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/av1-essentials-for-the-uninitiated-for-2024/"><u>AV1 Essentials  For the Uninitiated for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-5-best-sd-card-for-gopro-cameras-hero-87-included/"><u>2024 Approved  5 Best SD Card for GoPro Cameras -
