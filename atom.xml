Although the Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network provides you with access to the political process, you have to stream it online or pay a fee to purchase and download the video. What if you didn’t have the funds to buy so many videos? There’s a solution for you. Different apps allow you to download full-length videos of congressional floor debates, committee meetings, etc. In this article, we’ll provide you with various options you can utilize for downloading c-span videos; let’s take a look.</p><p><strong>What is C-Span?</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/download-c-span-video-2.jpg"                      alt="download-c-span-video-"                ></p><p>C-Span is a non-profit that has the sole purpose of providing public access to the political process. Through C-Span, the public can view congressional floor debates, hearings, and several more legislative sessions. C-Span was founded in 1979 by Brian Lamb and gets its profit from the cable industry rather than tax money. Although it started out showing sessions of the House of Representatives, C-Span later expanded with the development of additional channels.</p><p>One of C-Span’s most popular features is the call-in feature. C-Span broadcasts daily and occasionally covers the Canadian and British Parliament. It also tries to air proceedings from other governments which they believe are essential to their viewers. By 2010, C-Span was already available in over 100 million households.</p><p>C-Span doesn’t get its funding from the government, despite broadcasting sessions. Instead, the platform receives license fees from cable systems that provide their network to their customers. By providing unfettered video coverage of legislative proceedings, C-Span provides public figures with a channel they can reach the public with traditional media filters. A C-Span video averages 200MB for an hour if you’re going with the standard quality. However, for lower-quality versions of C-Span videos, you can get them at an average of 73MB for a full hour.</p><p>C-Span videos are available in MP4 formats because they’re the most compatible format with most video-playback apps and devices. In addition, C-Span allows its viewers to purchase physical DVDs to deliver through the mail, or it will enable you simply to pay for access to download the C-Span video.</p><p><strong>Ways to Download C-Span Video for Free</strong></p><p>There are various ways you can download C-Span videos for free.

On April 27th, 2017 the legendary camera manufacturer introduced the successor to the highly esteemed Nikon D7200. Although the Nikon D7500 has the same sensor and processor as the Nikon D500, the latest Nikon’s DSLR camera lacks some of the more professional features of the older model. The release of the Nikon D7500 is probably the biggest shake-up in the D7xxx series since the D90 model was replaced by D7000. Despite all the talk that the Nikon’s latest addition to the D7xxx series offers fewer possibilities to the professional users, the Nikon D7500 is a DSLR that can create images of the highest standard.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/nikon-d-7500-review.jpg"                      alt="nikon-d-7500-review"                ></p><h2 id="Nikon-D7500-Complete-Review"><a href="#Nikon-D7500-Complete-Review" class="headerlink" title="Nikon D7500 Complete Review"></a>Nikon D7500 Complete Review</h2><h4 id="1-Pros-and-Cons"><a href="#1-Pros-and-Cons" class="headerlink" title="1.Pros and Cons"></a>1.Pros and Cons</h4><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>ISO range</li><li>Superb sensor</li><li>Tilt-angle screen</li><li>Advanced Autofocus system</li><li>Built-in WiFi</li><li>Microphone and headphone jacks</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Only one SD card slot</li><li>Relatively poor rear screen resolution</li></ul><h4 id="2-Design"><a href="#2-Design" class="headerlink" title="2.Design"></a>2.Design</h4><p> The appearance of Nikon D7500 doesn’t step away from the traditional look of Nikon cameras and it is almost identical to the camera’s predecessor D7200. Perhaps the biggest physical difference between the two cameras is the weight. With 640 grams D7500 is significantly lighter and much easier to carry around than the D7200. On the back side of the body, the Nikon D7500 has a 3.2 inch 922.000-dots tilting touchscreen LCD that has a 170-degree wide viewing angle. In addition, the camera is also equipped with an Eye-level Pentaprism Viewfinder that has a 100% frame coverage and 0.94 magnification. The camera is weatherproof, which enables you to continue shooting even when the weather conditions are not in your favor.</p><h4 id="3-Sensor"><a href="#3-Sensor" class="headerlink" title="3.Sensor"></a>3.Sensor</h4><p> The Nikon cameras have moved the boundaries for decades, and even though the Nikon’s latest mid-sized DSLR camera may not be a game-changing camera it is still one of the best camera models in its price range. The camera’s Nikon DX Format, 20.9MP APS-C CMOS sensor has a slightly lower resolution than the sensor used in the Nikon D7500’s predecessor D7200. Omitting the low-pass filter enabled the camera manufacturers to compensate for the 4MP loss and to extend the D7500’s ISO sensitivity range.</p><h4 id="4-Processor"><a href="#4-Processor" class="headerlink" title="4.Processor"></a>4.Processor</h4><p> The Nikon EXPEED 5 image processor is 30% faster than the EXPEED 4 used with Nikon D7200, which enhances the video capability, burst speed and ISO sensitivity that can be extended up to the staggering 1.640.000. The combination of the Nikon D7500’s sensor and image processor guarantees that the camera will perform well in a variety of very different conditions and the demanding noise reduction algorithms enable the camera to perform well even in the low-light environments.</p><h4 id="5-Autofocus"><a href="#5-Autofocus" class="headerlink" title="5.Autofocus"></a>5.Autofocus</h4><p> The Nikon D7500 features a state of the art Multi-CAM 3500FX II Autofocus module with 9, 21 or 51 dynamic area points. The users can choose between eight different focus modes including Normal-area AF, Manual or the Auto AF Fine Tune. The Nikon’s latest D7xxx series mid-range camera is equipped with an in-camera image stabilizer that additionally contributes to the clarity and sharpness of the images produced by the DSLR. Furthermore, the D7500 can be paired with every AF lens released since 1986, which gives the camera versatility when it comes to optics.</p><h4 id="6-Image-quality"><a href="#6-Image-quality" class="headerlink" title="6.Image quality"></a>6.Image quality</h4><p> The Nikon D7500 is a photo and a video powerhouse capable of producing strong image quality at high resolutions. The Nikon’s latest D7xxx series addition can capture 4K UHD in 3,840 X 2, 160 resolution at 24, 25 and 30 frames per second, while Full HD videos can be recorded at 1,920 x 1,080 resolution and 60, 50, 30, 25 and 24 frame rate. The longest clip duration that the Nikon D7500 allows is 30 minutes and the camera also features a Time Lapse mode, which is perfect for shooting videos of the night sky or busy urban life.</p><p> The camera can save the raw video footage on SD, SDHC and SDXC memory cards in MOV or MPEG4 file formats. The D7500 has only one card slot and some professional users who require large quantities of storage space might be forced to look for solutions to this limitation. Still frames can be taken in three different file formats JPEG+RAW, JPEG or RAW at the maximum resolution of 5, 568 X 3, 712 pixels. With an ISO sensitivity range of 100-51.000 that can be extended up to 1.640.000, this camera can serve a wide variety of purposes in outdoor or in studio conditions.</p><h4 id="7-Controls"><a href="#7-Controls" class="headerlink" title="7.Controls"></a>7.Controls</h4><p> The Nikon D7500 features Exposure modes such as Manual, Aperture Priority or Special Effects that enable the camera users to select the mode that best fits the requirements of the scene. In addition, the camera features Scene modes like Portrait, Dusk&#x2F;Dawn or Close-up that automatically adjust the camera settings and enable the users to take a shot with ease.</p><p> All footage can be transferred via HDMI or built-in WiFi to another device. In order to utilize the WiFi feature, the users must install The Nikon SnapBridge application on their iOS or Android devices. The Nikon D7500 is equipped with an external microphone and headphone jacks, that enable the professional sound recording with the camera, but sound recording is only possible while recording video. Even though all the signs suggest that the Nikon D7500 is a remarkable camera capable of producing amazing footage, too little time has passed since its initial release and it remains to be seen how well it performs over an extended period of time.</p><h4 id="8-Key-features"><a href="#8-Key-features" class="headerlink" title="8.Key features"></a>8.Key features</h4><ul><li>Nikon DX Format, 23.5 X15.6 mm 20.9MP APS-C CMOS sensor</li><li>The Nikon EXPEED 5 image processor</li><li>ISO value can be expanded to 1. 640.000</li><li>4K UHD at 30p, 25p and 34p</li><li>Full HD at 60p</li><li>Tilting 3.2 inch 922k-dot Touchscreen LCD</li><li>Built-in WiFi connectivity</li><li>Multi-CAM 3500FX II Autofocus</li></ul><h4 id="9-Conclusion"><a href="#9-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="9.Conclusion"></a>9.Conclusion</h4><p> The Nikon EXPEED 5 image processor enables the D7500 to shoot a burst of 50 RAW files at the rate of 8fps. The camera’s EN-EL15a Rechargeable Li-ion Battery can hold for approximately 950 shots or nearly 80 minutes of recording HD footage. The Nikon D7500 is designed to meet all the demands a user might have since it can create breathtaking low-light landscapes, professional multimedia content or beautiful portraits. The Nikon’s latest mid-range DSLR camera in the D7xxx-series is a capable all-around camera that improves on the imperfections of the previous D7200 model but fails to live up to the standards set by the iconic D500. The Nikon D7500 DSLR camera can equally effectively serve the needs of photography or videography enthusiasts and professionals that demand only the best performances from their cameras.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><h5 id="Max-Wales-1"><a href="#Max-Wales-1" class="headerlink" title="Max Wales"></a>Max Wales</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p> The Nikon’s range of DSLR cameras has been broadened recently by the Nikon D7500.

Despite all the talk that the Nikon’s latest addition to the D7xxx series offers fewer possibilities to the professional users, the Nikon D7500 is a DSLR that can create images of the highest standard.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/nikon-d-7500-review.jpg"                      alt="nikon-d-7500-review"                ></p><h2 id="Nikon-D7500-Complete-Review-1"><a href="#Nikon-D7500-Complete-Review-1" class="headerlink" title="Nikon D7500 Complete Review"></a>Nikon D7500 Complete Review</h2><h4 id="1-Pros-and-Cons-1"><a href="#1-Pros-and-Cons-1" class="headerlink" title="1.Pros and Cons"></a>1.Pros and Cons</h4><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>ISO range</li><li>Superb sensor</li><li>Tilt-angle screen</li><li>Advanced Autofocus system</li><li>Built-in WiFi</li><li>Microphone and headphone jacks</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Only one SD card slot</li><li>Relatively poor rear screen resolution</li></ul><h4 id="2-Design-1"><a href="#2-Design-1" class="headerlink" title="2.Design"></a>2.Design</h4><p> The appearance of Nikon D7500 doesn’t step away from the traditional look of Nikon cameras and it is almost identical to the camera’s predecessor D7200.

Find out how much it would cost you in this article.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/music-video-cost-1.jpg"                      alt="music-video-cost"                ></p><p>The music production scene has significantly changed in the last decade. The amount of music and videos being made is much higher than ever. Due to this, the budget range is quite broad and can be quite confusing for first-timers. Although some people use record labels to pay for their music videos, others pay out-of-pocket.</p><p>When shooting a music video, you have to recognize that a lot goes into shooting the music video. It goes beyond the artist and includes the crew members who would show up to make it happen. There are also different aspects to consider when determining how much you need to shoot a music video. Luckily, we’re here to break down how much it will cost to shoot a music video for you. Then, you can use the information shared here to start planning your next music video.</p><p><strong>How Much Will It Cost to Shoot a Music Video?</strong></p><p>We’re noticing a shift in the music video category, with more people choosing to release video singles over audio singles. Additionally, several video-sharing platforms encourage artists to share and promote themselves in creative ways. However, how much will it cost to shoot a music video? Below is how you can determine the answer to that.</p><p><strong>Creating a Budget</strong></p><p>The budget for your music video usually covers pre-production, concept development, casting, storyboards, choreography, location fee, rehearsal, production equipment, on-camera talent, props, costumes, post-production, editing, and many more. For a professional video, you can budget anywhere from $20,000 to $500,000. Sometimes, it costs even more, depending on the concept you’re looking to achieve.</p><p>However, if you have a lower budget, you would have to forego the inclusion of high-end visual effects, expensive locations, and many more. However, you can still creatively convey your story even with a low budget.</p><p><strong>Estimated Production Costs</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/music-video-cost-2.jpg"                      alt="music-video-cost"                ></p><p>For an artist looking for a lower budget, the estimated cost of production for a day can range from $500 to $1,500. This usually depends on your location and the permits you need. There might be extras along the way, but this is the average amount to budget per day.</p><p>If you are shooting scenes in different outfits, you might also have to budget rental fees. This could significantly increase the cost of production, even without the inclusion of more factors like transportation and food during the shooting process. However, these are important because they determine how your video looks at the end. In addition, good locations can sometimes be pricey, and you might want to get a stylist for your wardrobe.</p><p>Additionally, artists have to consider the cost of production equipment. If you want professional options like a 4k camera and lighting kits, it will drastically increase the average production cost because they cost a lot to rent and maintain. However, you should note that the better the equipment, the higher the cost.</p><p><strong>Estimated Production Days</strong></p><p>Depending on the concept and storyboard of your video, it usually takes 2-3 days to edit your video after production. Sometimes, the editor’s fee determines how much editing will be carried out on your video. What makes up the cost of post-production includes the storage device for your video and the hourly cost of your editor. For example, if your editor would be using advanced visual effects, they could charge between 70-150 dollars for each hour. Colorists are also part of the post-production cost, and their fee usually depends on the final product quality you would like to achieve.</p><p><strong>Additional Costs</strong></p><p>Apart from production and post-production costs, there are several more costs you need to consider. These costs are essential because they help to make your video come together. One of the additional costs to consider is the cast and crew. A fantastic music video requires talented people. This could range from 7 to 30 people at the location. Sometimes it could be. It is hard to determine the cost of the cast and crew because while some people work on day rates, others accept payment at the end of a project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/music-video-cost-3.jpg"                      alt="music-video-cost"                ></p><p>You should also consider the cost of food as everyone has to be in the best state to shoot the music video. The cost of transporting from one location to another and moving the equipment needs to also be considered when you’re determining the additional costs to add to your music video.</p><p><strong>Bonus Tip: How to Edit a Music Video on Computer</strong></p><p>After production, that’s where editing your music video comes in. No one ever releases raw footage of their music video to the public. Therefore, there’s a need to enhance audio and video quality before releasing it to the public.

Production costs like the length, concept, location, and the actions you would like to take in the video can significantly change the cost.

Production costs like the length, concept, location, and the actions you would like to take in the video can significantly change the cost. Additionally, you have to factor in the extra costs like crew, casts, transportation, feeding, etc. However, if you want a music video professionally edited from start to finish, Wondershare Filmora doesn’t just help you cut costs; it also ensures you get an enhanced music video result at the end.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"

To add a sense of speed to still images, many creators like to add a radial blur effect to their photos. It instantly increases the dramatic effect of the captured pictures. Moreover, if you are taking photos of fast-moving objects, the radial blur effect can be advantageous in making the picture more appealing.</p><p>If you are unaware of the radial blur effect, this article can act as a guide. Through this article, you can learn how to add <strong>radial blur in Photoshop</strong> with the help of simple instructions.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-a-Radial-Blur-Effect"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-a-Radial-Blur-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is a Radial Blur Effect?"></a>Part 1: What is a Radial Blur Effect?</h2><p>The radial blur effect is somehow similar to motion blur. This effect can be created at a slow shutter speed in the camera, or you can move or rotate your cameras in certain ways to create this effect. Many photographers also create a motion blur effect by zooming in at a slow shutter speed. By adding this effect, you will create a tunnel vision in your photos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/radial-blur-effect-to-photos-1.jpg"                      alt="what is the radial blur effect"                ></p><p>Moreover, the <strong>radial blur effect</strong> can also evoke certain emotions by transforming the image.

The main reason behind the immense popularity of Photoshop is its polished and well-design interface. Along with an intuitive interface, it also consists of various AI-supported features. You can use its color grading tools to manage the saturation, brightness, hue, and contrast levels of your photo. Moreover, you can also add layers to your photo if you want to bring extra dynamics.</p><p>Photoshop also allows you to use its pre-built filters for further modifications. With a single tap, you can apply filters to the photos without making them look artificial or low-quality. Moreover, you can also perform basic photo editing by utilizing the options such as cropping and resizing. Apart from all these distinct features, Photoshop also enables you to add a radial blur effect to the pictures.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Create-Radial-Blur-Effect-in-Photoshop"><a href="#Steps-to-Create-Radial-Blur-Effect-in-Photoshop" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Create Radial Blur Effect in Photoshop"></a>Steps to Create Radial Blur Effect in Photoshop</h3><p>Are you eager to learn how to create <strong>radial motion blur in Photoshop</strong>?

If you wanted to be really creative you could find something like these:</p><p> A Well Polished Table</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reflection-surface.jpg"                      alt="reflection-surface"                ></p><p> A Crystal&#x2F;Glass Ball</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/crystal-ball.jpg"                      alt="reflection-photography-for-iPhone"                ></p><p> Water in a wine glass (turns everything upside down too!)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/water-reflection.jpg"                      alt="water-reflection"                ></p><h4 id="2-Pay-Attention-to-Composition"><a href="#2-Pay-Attention-to-Composition" class="headerlink" title="2.  Pay Attention to Composition"></a>2.  Pay Attention to Composition</h4><p> Composition is the very basis of good photography, as the person taking the picture you decide the scene. The most integral part of good composition is the rule of thirds. This means you should divide up the scene&#x2F;subject into 9 equal squares&#x2F;rectangles (depending on frame).</p><p> You should put the subject or the most important parts of the scene into one or of the lines. Typically we have an impulse to put the subject straight in the middle of the shot, however placing the subject in othe of the other lines off to the side produces a far more engaging photo.</p><p> It is also really effective to have the subject where the gridlines intersect. This makes the image standout from others in social media feeds. It subconsciously pulls our attention.</p><p> iPhone already has a feature for you to bring up lines before you take the photo with the rule of thirds:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reflection-composition-tips.jpg"                      alt="reflection-composition-tips"                ></p><p> To activate the lines simply go to <strong>Settings &gt; Camera and Photographs &gt; Grid</strong></p><h4 id="3-Keep-it-Simple"><a href="#3-Keep-it-Simple" class="headerlink" title="3.

Of course if the reflective surface reflects too well and you just focus on that. The image might come out as looking the same as if you had just pointed and shot the subject.</p><p> You should have a mix of the physical real life subject and the reflection. This way you can demonstrate how effective reflective photography is. The iPhone is well equipped for this with the ability to take high quality photos of even moving subjects in bursts.</p><p> All you need to do is hold down the shutter&#x2F;take photo button and burst mode automatically takes lots of photos until you release.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reality-and-reflection.jpg"                      alt="reality-and-reflection"                ></p><h4 id="5-Texture"><a href="#5-Texture" class="headerlink" title="5.

Apple has really invested in improving the quality of it’s in-built lenses in their latest models of the iPhone. Much of the advertising now concerns the stunning photos it’s users can take.

The Surface"></a>1.  The Surface</h4><p> Of course the number one rule of reflective photography is that you have a reflective surface! It doesn’t have to be as simple as a mirror though, as the picture above shows lakes and pools are great if it is a clam weather day. You want to make sure that your surface is clean as far as possible to avoid distraction. If you wanted to be really creative you could find something like these:</p><p> A Well Polished Table</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reflection-surface.jpg"                      alt="reflection-surface"                ></p><p> A Crystal&#x2F;Glass Ball</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/crystal-ball.jpg"                      alt="reflection-photography-for-iPhone"                ></p><p> Water in a wine glass (turns everything upside down too!)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/water-reflection.jpg"                      alt="water-reflection"                ></p><h4 id="2-Pay-Attention-to-Composition-2"><a href="#2-Pay-Attention-to-Composition-2" class="headerlink" title="2.  Pay Attention to Composition"></a>2.  Pay Attention to Composition</h4><p> Composition is the very basis of good photography, as the person taking the picture you decide the scene. The most integral part of good composition is the rule of thirds. This means you should divide up the scene&#x2F;subject into 9 equal squares&#x2F;rectangles (depending on frame).</p><p> You should put the subject or the most important parts of the scene into one or of the lines. Typically we have an impulse to put the subject straight in the middle of the shot, however placing the subject in othe of the other lines off to the side produces a far more engaging photo.</p><p> It is also really effective to have the subject where the gridlines intersect. This makes the image standout from others in social media feeds. It subconsciously pulls our attention.</p><p> iPhone already has a feature for you to bring up lines before you take the photo with the rule of thirds:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reflection-composition-tips.jpg"                      alt="reflection-composition-tips"                ></p><p> To activate the lines simply go to <strong>Settings &gt; Camera and Photographs &gt; Grid</strong></p><h4 id="3-Keep-it-Simple-2"><a href="#3-Keep-it-Simple-2" class="headerlink" title="3.  Keep it Simple"></a>3.  Keep it Simple</h4><p> Reflective photography works best when the scene isn’t busy and there is nothing too distracting. Having one focus&#x2F;subject will produce a clean image and the reflection of the subject will be far more effective.</p><p> Reflective photography should convey a sense of calm, simplicity and tranquility. If the photograph has more than one pull of focus you’re likely to lose this.</p><p> Good</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/keep-the-image-simple.jpg"                      alt="keep-the-image-simple"                ></p><p> Awful</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/awful-composition.jpg"                      alt="awful-composition"                ></p><h4 id="4-Reality-and-Reflection-2"><a href="#4-Reality-and-Reflection-2" class="headerlink" title="4.  Reality and Reflection"></a>4.  Reality and Reflection</h4><p> Don’t just focus on the reflection, these tend to distract from how good the reflection is. Of course if the reflective surface reflects too well and you just focus on that. The image might come out as looking the same as if you had just pointed and shot the subject.</p><p> You should have a mix of the physical real life subject and the reflection. This way you can demonstrate how effective reflective photography is. The iPhone is well equipped for this with the ability to take high quality photos of even moving subjects in bursts.</p><p> All you need to do is hold down the shutter&#x2F;take photo button and burst mode automatically takes lots of photos until you release.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reality-and-reflection.jpg"                      alt="reality-and-reflection"                ></p><h4 id="5-Texture-2"><a href="#5-Texture-2" class="headerlink" title="5.  Texture"></a>5.  Texture</h4><p> Using a still reflective surface is good, but reflective photos are more effective if you have been able to capture texture. Where the reflective surface distorts the real life subject, you’re able to artistically capture an entirely unique affect each time. This is why waves are a great way to create a truly different image with each shot.</p><p> It is also just good photography practice to have your subjects bend and distort the light. The contrasts make for an aesthetically beautiful image, and makes post production optimization even easier.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-use-of-texture.jpg"                      alt="make-use-of-texture"                ></p><h3 id="Post-Production-Reflective-Effects-2"><a href="#Post-Production-Reflective-Effects-2" class="headerlink" title="Post Production Reflective Effects"></a>Post Production Reflective Effects</h3><p> It’s possible to create great reflective photographs by using reflective effects after you have taken it. You can deceptively take one of your great photos and use the reflective effect to make it appear on a reflective looking surface. Here’s some examples of photos that were created using this effect through software:</p><p> The image of the lamp and the puddle were taken separately and meshed together using an app…</p><p> You can do this on iPhone using these apps:</p><table><thead><tr><th>App</th><th>Requirements</th><th>Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Reflect Mirror Camera</td><td>iOS 8.0 or later</td><td><a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reflect-mirror-camera/id898143628?mt=8" >$2.99 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></td></tr><tr><td>Reflection</td><td>iOS 8.0 or later</td><td><a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reflection-create-water-reflection-photo-arts/id672111257?mt=8" >$2.99 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></td></tr><tr><td>Photo Reflection</td><td>iOS 9.0 or later</td><td><a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/photo-reflection/id484604482?mt=8" >Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></td></tr><tr><td>Photo Mirror Effects</td><td>iOS 8.0 or later</td><td><a class="link"   href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/photo-mirror-effects-reflection-editor/id1019418266?mt=8" >Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id="1-Reflect-Mirror-Camera-2"><a href="#1-Reflect-Mirror-Camera-2" class="headerlink" title="1.

The phrase dates back to the earliest days of Hollywood when movies were still being made on film. The main roll of film was called the A-roll, and a second roll of film called the B roll, or B-reel, was used for cutaway shots and transitions.</p><p>Now that we know that, let’s dive in!</p><h2 id="1-B-roll-In-TV-And-Movies"><a href="#1-B-roll-In-TV-And-Movies" class="headerlink" title="1.

It usually refers to extra footage captured with a movie camera while keeping the lighting consistent between scenes in the movie industry. When the filmmaker doesn’t want to show any dialogue or action on screen but needs some movement within the frame, it might be utilized as filler.</p><p>B roll has been used from the first silent movies, including D.W.

It is used by filmmakers when they lack the funds for pricey films or when they want to showcase their originality. It’s also a fantastic method for narrating stories devoid of conversation. It might be anything, such a view of a landscape or a person’s hands holding up a sign with words on it.</p><p>For instance, wider shots are frequently used when someone is giving a speech while seated behind a podium so that we can see both them and their surroundings, such as audience members standing close and applauding or security personnel.</p><h2 id="2-Methods-to-use-b-roll"><a href="#2-Methods-to-use-b-roll" class="headerlink" title="2.

Most of the time, filmmakers don’t use B roll footage. One good way to use it is to use it as a way to move from one scene to the next. It can also be used to set the mood for an event or show what time of day it is when filming.</p><p>The ideal way to use B roll is to put it behind interviews. This kind of footage can be used in three ways: as establishing shots, cutaways, and transitions. Most of the time, the first few minutes of an interview or video help set the scene with “establishing shots.”</p><p>On the other hand, cutaways can show how different people react to what is being said in an interview. After all, transitions are commonly used to switch from one person’s experience with a certain topic to another person’s experience with the same topic. All of these different kinds of footage give filmmakers and videographers more freedom to tell their stories without relying too much on dialogue or narration.</p><h2 id="3-What-types-of-b-roll-are-there"><a href="#3-What-types-of-b-roll-are-there" class="headerlink" title="3. What types of b roll are there?"></a>3. What types of b roll are there?</h2><p>We’ll examine the top 5 uses for B rolls across a variety of video genres and discuss how to implement them effectively in your own projects.</p><h3 id="1-Archival-b-roll-footage"><a href="#1-Archival-b-roll-footage" class="headerlink" title="1. Archival b roll footage"></a>1. Archival b roll footage</h3><p>Aerial B roll is the solution when you like to show your viewers where your film is being recorded or when you are changing locations and want them to know it. The plane takes off and lands in another city, and then shots of the city, its landmarks, its famous streets, etc. are shown. You have probably seen this type of B roll footage in movies and TV shows. These images aid in putting the viewer in the character’s current location. Check out this collection of setting images from the Neighbors television series.</p><h3 id="2-Visual-detail-b-roll-footage"><a href="#2-Visual-detail-b-roll-footage" class="headerlink" title="2. Visual detail b roll footage"></a>2. Visual detail b roll footage</h3><p>Including archival material in your video allows your audience to experience a previously covered or historically significant story as it occurred. Look at this illustration from Netflix’s 14 Peaks: Nothing Is Impossible, which was made utilizing old b roll film from the era to help the viewer connect with the narrative.</p><h3 id="3-Storytelling-b-roll-footage"><a href="#3-Storytelling-b-roll-footage" class="headerlink" title="3. Storytelling b roll footage"></a>3. Storytelling b roll footage</h3><p>B roll footage can be used to tell a story that supports the narrative of your video. For example, in this video interview of Tom DeLonge, the speaker talks about living in a neighborhood. The B rolls show him driving around in his car, skateboarding on the street in the 90’s. These add to the story the video creator wants to talk about not seeing people with a disability differently.</p><h3 id="4-Undirected-b-roll-footage"><a href="#4-Undirected-b-roll-footage" class="headerlink" title="4. Undirected b roll footage"></a>4. Undirected b roll footage</h3><p>This particular kind of B roll film is captured without any direction being given to your character, as the name suggests. For the purposes of an interview video, for instance, these can be straightforward close-up views of your character’s hands and facial expressions. On the other hand, while you’re doing a documentary, you might record your subject participating in everyday activities.</p><h3 id="5-Atmospheric-b-roll-footage"><a href="#5-Atmospheric-b-roll-footage" class="headerlink" title="5. Atmospheric b roll footage"></a>5. Atmospheric b roll footage</h3><p>When you are sharing a narrative that has been told in the past or that has historical significance, incorporating archival material into your video gives your audience the opportunity to see the story as it occurred at the time. This is especially useful when you are discussing a narrative that has been experienced in the past or that has futuristic relevance.</p><p>Have a look at the scenes from the episode “14 Peaks: Nothing Is Impossible” that can be found on Netflix. As a result of the use of archive film footage of b roll from the relevant time period in its production, the audience is able to connect with the narrative on a deeper level.</p><h3 id="6-Pick-up-shots"><a href="#6-Pick-up-shots" class="headerlink" title="6. Pick-up shots"></a>6. Pick-up shots</h3><p>A pick-up is a tiny shot added to previously captured material. Re-shoots involve redoing entire scenes. Both types of shots are commonly added during film editing to fix, logic, continuity, or quality flaws. These photos happen a while after the sets have been taken down, clothes and props stowed, and the actors and crew have gone on to new projects.</p><p>If flaws were discovered during primary photography, the directors could have requested another take. The producer and director should weigh the cost of rejoining cast and crew against the need for pick-ups or re-shoots to address storyline flaws (or worse) in the final edit.</p><h3 id="7-A-roll-vs-b-roll"><a href="#7-A-roll-vs-b-roll" class="headerlink" title="7. A roll vs b roll"></a>7. A roll vs b roll</h3><p>Imagine the A roll as part of the video’s story. This could be a documentary film, news show, or scripted sketch. Everything else on your editing table must be rearranged to fit it. When the speaker in the following video is directly talking to the camera or interviewer, this is A roll footage. The video’s most crucial segments were filmed with primary footage.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We sincerely hope that this post will be of use to you in making your films more cinematic. You not only know how to film and edit your videos utilizing B rolls, you also have an extremely effective hack that allows you to generate amazing videos using stock footage. This is both impressive and unique.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-breaking-down-virtual-reality-jargon/"><u>2024 Approved  Breaking Down Virtual Reality Jargon</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/top-10-best-hexacopter-drones-for-2024/"><u>Top 10 Best Hexacopter Drones for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/in-2024-advanced-strategies-for-changing-user-numbers-in-tiktok/"><u>In 2024, Advanced Strategies for Changing User Numbers in TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/a-step-by-step-approach-to-zooming-success-for-2024/"><u>A Step-by-Step Approach to Zooming Success for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/new-chucklechamber-endless-options-to-spread-smiles/"><u>[New] ChuckleChamber  Endless Options to Spread Smiles</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/perfecting-the-art-of-audio-in-audacity-professionally/"><u>Perfecting the Art of Audio in Audacity Professionally</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/speech-to-text-powered-by-microsoft-word-your-pathway-to-efficient-workflow-management/"><u>Speech to Text Powered by Microsoft Word  Your Pathway to Efficient Workflow Management</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/updated-become-a-photo-editing-wizard-with-lunapic-expertise/"><u>[Updated] Become a Photo Editing Wizard with LunaPic Expertise</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/clear-up-your-photos-best-10-online-image-enhancers-revealed-for-2024/"><u>Clear Up Your Photos  Best 10 Online Image Enhancers Revealed for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/revolutionary-videography-uncovering-the-top-cameras-of-2024/"><u>Revolutionary Videography  Uncovering the Top Cameras of 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-chromatic-excellence-program/"><u>2024 Approved  Chromatic Excellence Program</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/in-2024-cast-distribution-license-for-screen-viewing/"><u>In 2024, Cast Distribution License for Screen Viewing</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-list-of-outstanding-storytelling-youtubers-this-year/"><u>The Ultimate List of Outstanding Storytelling YouTubers This Year</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/amplify-iphone-imagery-with-lighting-hacks-for-2024/"><u>Amplify iPhone Imagery with Lighting Hacks for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-selection-of-high-quality-tiktok-backdrops/"><u>In 2024, A Selection of High-Quality TikTok Backdrops</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-crafting-compelling-narratives-with-spotify-ads/"><u>2024 Approved  Crafting Compelling Narratives with Spotify Ads</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/hack-the-art-world-essential-free-3d-psd-files/"><u>Hack the Art World  Essential Free 3D PSD Files</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/exclusive-list-of-premium-3d-blu-ray-players-reviewed/"><u>Exclusive List of Premium 3D Blu-Ray Players Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/removing-vibration-effects-from-drones-recordings/"><u>Removing Vibration Effects From Drones' Recordings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-breathtaking-stunts-and-jumps-2022-fig-skates/"><u>2024 Approved  Breathtaking Stunts and Jumps -

So I will show you how to reduce background noise step by step using Wondershare Filmora.</p><h3 id="Steps-for-reducing-background-noise-1"><a href="#Steps-for-reducing-background-noise-1" class="headerlink" title="Steps for reducing background noise"></a>Steps for reducing background noise</h3><p>Step1 Launch Wonderhsare Filmora and import your clip into it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/filmroa-questions-and-answers-18.png"                      alt="launch filmora and import clip"                ></p><p>Step2 Double-click the clip you want to denoise.

You might have noticed a crown icon next to some features in Filmora. It is for specific editing features accessible to users only with a Filmora license.</p><p>These features include 4K video export, keyframing, speed ramping, and many more. Purchase a Filmora license from their official website and enjoy these beautiful features.</p><h2 id="Question-5-Filmora-purchase-1"><a href="#Question-5-Filmora-purchase-1" class="headerlink" title="Question 5: Filmora purchase"></a>Question 5: Filmora purchase</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/filmroa-questions-and-answers-27.png"                      alt="will next versions of filmora be valid on the lifetime license"                ></p><p>If you bought Filmora 9 lifetime license years ago, you can upgrade to Filmora X and use the same license. However, since Filmora X, there is no lifetime license anymore. Instead, a perpetual license is made for a specific version of Filmora. It includes minor updates continually with payment of a single fee, but for major upgrades, like Filmora 11 to Filmora 12, there will be an additional fee. Therefore, the answer is no.</p><h2 id="Final-Words-1"><a href="#Final-Words-1" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h2><p>We are done with our questions.

Being a photo text editor, you need to be careful about every element that is across the photo. Thus, to make your photos look perfect with the added text, you should be aware of the few tips that are featured below:</p><h3 id="1-Understanding-the-Perspective-3"><a href="#1-Understanding-the-Perspective-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Understanding the Perspective"></a>1. Understanding the Perspective</h3><p>Adding text as a perspective is believed to be an inclusive way of providing viewers with the idea of the image and helping them understand it to the fullest. If you are looking forward to writing a text on photos,you can give your text a little angle and appearance according to the image shoot for a good illusion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-text-in-image-9.jpg"                      alt="understand image perspective"                ></p><h3 id="2-Blending-in-with-the-Photo’s-Properties-3"><a href="#2-Blending-in-with-the-Photo’s-Properties-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Blending in with the Photo’s Properties"></a>2. Blending in with the Photo’s Properties</h3><p>It is essential for you to figure out the right contrast of text that matches or immerses perfectly with the photo. This helps you ensure that the text of your photo stands out to the viewers with no affective disturbances. Not only will it look good, but it also won’t tamper with the quality of the photo that it holds across.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-text-in-image-10.jpg"                      alt=" blend text with image properties"                ></p><h3 id="3-Look-for-Negative-Space-3"><a href="#3-Look-for-Negative-Space-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Look for Negative Space"></a>3. Look for Negative Space</h3><p>When you consider adding text across a photo, it is highly advised that you should always go for an option that contains a general space for covering. Often referred to as negative space, utilizing that space for the text may be the perfect way that you can consider writing a text on photos. This puts no effect on the photo and helps the user display the whole idea with prominence.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-text-in-image-11.jpg"                      alt="add text in negative space"                ></p><h3 id="4-Framing-the-Text-3"><a href="#4-Framing-the-Text-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Framing the Text"></a>4. Framing the Text</h3><p>If you go for prominence, you should always use elements that are meant for bringing prominence. Text that is to be highlighted with purity across a photo should be framed rather than any other tactful technique. This helps you create a clear focal point while sustaining the quality of the image. Following this, it also keeps a good view across the photo as a subjective associate picture.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-text-in-image-12.jpg"                      alt="frame the text"                ></p><h3 id="5-Control-your-Sizes-and-Styles-3"><a href="#5-Control-your-Sizes-and-Styles-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Control your Sizes and Styles"></a>5. Control your Sizes and Styles</h3><p>Make sure that you always select a font size or style that is relevant to the photo. The use of inappropriate sizes and styles in photos takes away the essence of the picture. A balance across these traits is essential for the user to bring. Capture the viewers’ attention without compromising the quality of the photo itself.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-text-in-image-13.jpg"                      alt="select accurate font size and style"                ></p><h2 id="The-Bottom-Line-3"><a href="#The-Bottom-Line-3" class="headerlink" title="The Bottom Line"></a>The Bottom Line</h2><p>The best illustration of images is not possible without adding typography to them. People add text to the images to share social media posts or create poster events.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Brand-Awakening-on-Reddit-7-Easy-Steps-to-Market-Mastery"><a href="#Brand-Awakening-on-Reddit-7-Easy-Steps-to-Market-Mastery" class="headerlink" title="Brand Awakening on Reddit: 7 Easy Steps to Market Mastery"></a>Brand Awakening on Reddit: 7 Easy Steps to Market Mastery</h2><p>The past few years have taught business owners a valuable lesson. It has never been easier to start an online business and succeed.</p><p>There are plenty of ways to do this. But Reddit marketing is proving to be among the most promising ones. Reddit is a platform where communities of over 1.5 billion users in total gather every month.</p><p>Using the right Reddit marketing strategy can result in more sales, clients, and traffic. This guide will be your crash course on how to do Reddit marketing. Expect tons of actionable tips that will help you succeed faster.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-Does-Reddit-Work"><a href="#Part-1-How-Does-Reddit-Work" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. How Does Reddit Work?"></a>Part 1. How Does Reddit Work?</h2><p>Reddit is a place for gathering. It’s where communities of all interests can connect and share ideas, knowledge, experiences, and more.</p><p>The rules of Reddit are simple.</p><p><strong>Upvotes &amp; Downvotes</strong></p><p>First, there are Upvotes and Downvotes. This determines which posts go on top and which ones get buried down below. The more Upvotes a post has, the more it will be seen. The more Downvotes it has, the more irrelevant it becomes.</p><p><strong>SubReddits</strong></p><p>Subreddits are communities within Reddit. Each subreddit is dedicated to a topic. For example, there are subreddits about food, gaming, and finance…… you name it!</p><p>Each subreddit has its members. Some have hundreds of thousands of members, while other subreddits only have a couple of hundred or fewer.</p><p>The idea behind them is to make Reddit a more organized place where you can easily find what you’re looking for.</p><p><strong>Content and Posting</strong></p><p>The most important part of Reddit is the posts. What you post can have a significant impact on whether you reach a vast audience or not.</p><p>Ideally, posting valuable advice that will genuinely help someone out works best. However, you can also post entertaining content, personal experiences, and more.</p><p>You’ll be fine if it doesn’t go against Reddit’s guidelines.</p><p><strong>Reddit Karma</strong></p><p>Last but not least, Reddit Karma is another crucial feature. It is a status symbol. It reflects how much you contribute to each Reddit community. The more Karma you have, the more authority and value your actions on Reddit have.</p><p>You can earn more Reddit karma by receiving Upvotes on your posts and comments.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Should-You-Do-Reddit-Marketing"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Should-You-Do-Reddit-Marketing" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Why Should You Do Reddit Marketing?"></a>Part 2. Why Should You Do Reddit Marketing?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/reddit-marketing-logo.png"                      alt="reddit marketing"                ></p><p>The main reason you should learn how to market on Reddit is because of its vast number of daily and monthly users. Let’s look at some facts.</p><ul><li>Reddit currently gets <strong>1.7 billion</strong>monthly users</li><li>It is ranked <strong>#19</strong>out of all the other sites on the internet globally</li><li>It is also ranked <strong>#12</strong>among all the websites in the United States</li></ul><p>All this means is that you have billions of potential customers to reach on Reddit each month. As a result, it may be the perfect platform for you to market your business and achieve amazing results.</p><p>There are even more good news and reasons to attempt a Reddit marketing strategy for your business.</p><p>Reddit has a somewhat unique audience. Close to <strong>50%</strong> of Reddit users don’t use Instagram. A higher percentage than this don’t use TikTok as well. Additionally, <strong>90%</strong> of Reddit users go there to learn about new products and brands.</p><p>That is an excellent opportunity to use Reddit marketing for your business. It’s literally where people go to learn more about your business.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Market-on-Reddit-5-Actionable-Ways"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Market-on-Reddit-5-Actionable-Ways" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How to Market on Reddit - 5 Actionable Ways"></a>Part 3. How to Market on Reddit - 5 Actionable Ways</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/how-to-market-on-reddit.png"                      alt="marketing on reddit"                ></p><p><strong>Create Unique Content and Provide Value for Your Audience</strong></p><p>Content is king when it comes to Reddit. To get good results, your content MUST help the reader in some way. Find out what your audience’s problems are and pour your heart and soul into finding a solution for them.</p><p>It will be worth it in the long run.</p><p><strong>Be Consistent and Persistent</strong></p><p>Doing one Reddit post, no matter how good it may be, will rarely do the trick. The key to creating any type of content is consistency and value.</p><p>There are three major reasons why this is crucial:</p><p>- It builds trust among your audience. This makes it easier to sell to them later</p><p>- Adds a lot to your credibility. The more you increase your credibility, the easier it is to sell to new viewers</p><p>- It gets more eyes on you. The more content you post, the more potential customers you acquire</p><p><strong>Listen to Feedback and Host AMAs</strong></p><p>AMA stands for “Ask Me Anything”. This offers a perfect opportunity for you to connect with your audience. It lets you find out more about them. This is crucial information that will help you increase your sales and make more money in the long run.</p><p>Feedback is very important for a growing business. It’s a simple way to research your audience. Remember, the more you know about their fears, issues, attractions, and similar… the more you can improve your brand and meet their demands.</p><p>Reddit has its own<a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/" >AMA subreddit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It currently has over 22 million members. Here, you can post who you are and what you do. Then, expect plenty of questions from your audience.</p><p><strong>Always Support Your Audience</strong></p><p>Making money is great. But, always promoting your business and talking about yourself will never bring good results. The key is to put your audience in front.</p><p>You need to care about your customers. Talk to them, offer free advice, listen to their needs, and engage more with them. The more you put their interests ahead of your own, the better the impact on your business.</p><p>For example, when a user asked “<a class="link"   href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1fel08/what%5Fcompany%5Fhas%5Fsuch%5Fgood%5Fcustomer%5Fservice%5Fthat/" >What company has such good customer service that every other company should aspire to? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>“, the comments were overflooded with the word “Amazon”.</p><p><strong>Advertise on Reddit</strong></p><p>There are two types of Reddit ads you need to be doing:</p><ul><li>Takeover Ads</li><li>Promoted Ads</li></ul><p>To be successful with your Reddit marketing strategy, you must know how to run ads.</p><p>The first step is to go over as many<a class="link"   href="https://www.reddiquette.com/reddit-ad-examples/" >examples of successful Reddit marketing campaigns <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as you can.</p><p>Second, you must familiarize yourself with<a class="link"   href="https://redditinc.force.com/helpcenter/s/article/Reddit-Advertising-Policy-Overview" >Reddit’s advertising policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Make sure you’re not creating an ad that goes against their rules.</p><p>Lastly, have a clear objective. Know why you’re creating your ad. Is it to increase your audience? Is it to get more sales? Is there another reason?</p><p>Knowing all of this will significantly improve your results and also give you insights on what type of Reddit ad to create. And now, you know how to market on Reddit. So, go out there and make this happen.</p><h2 id="Part-4-A-Bonus-Tip-The-Best-Video-Editor-for-Reddit"><a href="#Part-4-A-Bonus-Tip-The-Best-Video-Editor-for-Reddit" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

As mentioned earlier, the Pandemic era was the hardest time; many changes took place. One great change was that schools, offices, and universities were being managed from home.

If you are using the 2016 or later version of the app, you are required to enable the Developer tab that allows you to add customized instances of Windows Media Player, and modify the speed rate of the clips from there.</p><p>When several instances of Windows Media Player are added, the speed of each instance can be configured individually to play a separate video clip. This approach could be helpful to make the entire PowerPoint presentation more dynamic and lucrative that further keeps the audience engaged throughout the session.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Change PowerPoint Video Playback Speed to Speed Up Video</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Change the Speed of a PowerPoint Animation</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">FAQs About Change PPT Speed</a></p><p>Why Not Customize the Video Speed Before Adding it to PowerPoint?

Press <strong>Ctrl</strong> + <strong>A</strong> to select all the objects on the canvas. Now, modify the value in the <strong>Duration</strong> field that is present in the <strong>Timing</strong> section of the ribbon.</p><p>Where increasing the duration slows down the animation speed, decreasing it speeds up the animation.

Some of the common ones are listed below:</p><ul><li>You may have not configured the playback speed correctly (To fix this, go to the Windows Media Player Properties box as explained earlier, and configure various resolution and speed options accordingly)</li><li>Your GPU is old, and doesn’t support the resolution of the video clip (To fix this, go to File &gt; Info &gt; Compress Media and choose a lower resolution) (Choose Presentation Quality on the Microsoft PowerPoint 2010 – PowerPoint 2016 versions)</li><li>Hardware acceleration is turned off. (To fix this, go to File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Display and uncheck the ‘Display Slide Show hardware graphics acceleration’ box)</li></ul><p><strong>Q2) Why I cannot insert video in PowerPoint?</strong></p><p>You may want to check if the video is of a compatible format. It would be good to use an MP4 video as it integrates seamlessly with most applications.</p><p><strong>Q3) Which video format is best for PowerPoint?</strong></p><p>Listed below are some of the formats that PowerPoint supports:</p><ul><li>*.asf</li><li>*.avi</li><li>*.mp4, *.m4v, *.mov</li><li>*.mpg, *.mpeg</li><li>*.wmv</li></ul><p>However, considering the popularity and compatibility, MP4 is the format that is suggested by many professionals.</p><p><strong>Q4) Why PowerPoint cannot play media?</strong></p><p>Some most common reasons for this issue include:</p><ul><li><strong>Incompatible Media</strong> – To fix this, go to File &gt; Info and click ‘Optimize Compatibility’ (The tile will automatically appear if the presentation has an incompatible media file)</li><li><strong>Unrecognized Format</strong> – To fix this, check if the format of the video is supported by PowerPoint. If not, consider using an effective converter like Wondershare UniConverter to convert the clip to a compatible format before importing</li><li><strong>Missing Codecs</strong> – To fix this, install the required codecs on your PC. Nevertheless, if you’re using an MP4 file, it is unlikely that you encounter such an issue</li><li><strong>Overly Populated ‘Temp’ Folder</strong> – To fix this, type <strong>%TEMP%</strong> in the search box, and press <strong>Enter</strong>. Now, press <strong>Ctrl</strong> + <strong>A</strong> to select all the contents, and hit <strong>Delete</strong> to get rid of them.

Some of the common ones are listed below:</p><ul><li>You may have not configured the playback speed correctly (To fix this, go to the Windows Media Player Properties box as explained earlier, and configure various resolution and speed options accordingly)</li><li>Your GPU is old, and doesn’t support the resolution of the video clip (To fix this, go to File &gt; Info &gt; Compress Media and choose a lower resolution) (Choose Presentation Quality on the Microsoft PowerPoint 2010 – PowerPoint 2016 versions)</li><li>Hardware acceleration is turned off. (To fix this, go to File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Display and uncheck the ‘Display Slide Show hardware graphics acceleration’ box)</li></ul><p><strong>Q2) Why I cannot insert video in PowerPoint?</strong></p><p>You may want to check if the video is of a compatible format. It would be good to use an MP4 video as it integrates seamlessly with most applications.</p><p><strong>Q3) Which video format is best for PowerPoint?</strong></p><p>Listed below are some of the formats that PowerPoint supports:</p><ul><li>*.asf</li><li>*.avi</li><li>*.mp4, *.m4v, *.mov</li><li>*.mpg, *.mpeg</li><li>*.wmv</li></ul><p>However, considering the popularity and compatibility, MP4 is the format that is suggested by many professionals.</p><p><strong>Q4) Why PowerPoint cannot play media?</strong></p><p>Some most common reasons for this issue include:</p><ul><li><strong>Incompatible Media</strong> – To fix this, go to File &gt; Info and click ‘Optimize Compatibility’ (The tile will automatically appear if the presentation has an incompatible media file)</li><li><strong>Unrecognized Format</strong> – To fix this, check if the format of the video is supported by PowerPoint. If not, consider using an effective converter like Wondershare UniConverter to convert the clip to a compatible format before importing</li><li><strong>Missing Codecs</strong> – To fix this, install the required codecs on your PC. Nevertheless, if you’re using an MP4 file, it is unlikely that you encounter such an issue</li><li><strong>Overly Populated ‘Temp’ Folder</strong> – To fix this, type <strong>%TEMP%</strong> in the search box, and press <strong>Enter</strong>. Now, press <strong>Ctrl</strong> + <strong>A</strong> to select all the contents, and hit <strong>Delete</strong> to get rid of them.

Some of the common ones are listed below:</p><ul><li>You may have not configured the playback speed correctly (To fix this, go to the Windows Media Player Properties box as explained earlier, and configure various resolution and speed options accordingly)</li><li>Your GPU is old, and doesn’t support the resolution of the video clip (To fix this, go to File &gt; Info &gt; Compress Media and choose a lower resolution) (Choose Presentation Quality on the Microsoft PowerPoint 2010 – PowerPoint 2016 versions)</li><li>Hardware acceleration is turned off. (To fix this, go to File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Display and uncheck the ‘Display Slide Show hardware graphics acceleration’ box)</li></ul><p><strong>Q2) Why I cannot insert video in PowerPoint?</strong></p><p>You may want to check if the video is of a compatible format. It would be good to use an MP4 video as it integrates seamlessly with most applications.</p><p><strong>Q3) Which video format is best for PowerPoint?</strong></p><p>Listed below are some of the formats that PowerPoint supports:</p><ul><li>*.asf</li><li>*.avi</li><li>*.mp4, *.m4v, *.mov</li><li>*.mpg, *.mpeg</li><li>*.wmv</li></ul><p>However, considering the popularity and compatibility, MP4 is the format that is suggested by many professionals.</p><p><strong>Q4) Why PowerPoint cannot play media?</strong></p><p>Some most common reasons for this issue include:</p><ul><li><strong>Incompatible Media</strong> – To fix this, go to File &gt; Info and click ‘Optimize Compatibility’ (The tile will automatically appear if the presentation has an incompatible media file)</li><li><strong>Unrecognized Format</strong> – To fix this, check if the format of the video is supported by PowerPoint. If not, consider using an effective converter like Wondershare UniConverter to convert the clip to a compatible format before importing</li><li><strong>Missing Codecs</strong> – To fix this, install the required codecs on your PC. Nevertheless, if you’re using an MP4 file, it is unlikely that you encounter such an issue</li><li><strong>Overly Populated ‘Temp’ Folder</strong> – To fix this, type <strong>%TEMP%</strong> in the search box, and press <strong>Enter</strong>. Now, press <strong>Ctrl</strong> + <strong>A</strong> to select all the contents, and hit <strong>Delete</strong> to get rid of them.

Press <strong>Ctrl</strong> + <strong>A</strong> to select all the objects on the canvas. Now, modify the value in the <strong>Duration</strong> field that is present in the <strong>Timing</strong> section of the ribbon.</p><p>Where increasing the duration slows down the animation speed, decreasing it speeds up the animation. Simply put, the value in the duration field is inversely proportional to the speed of the animation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-animation-speed-powerpoint.jpg"                      alt="change animation speed powerpoint"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> You can follow the same procedure to manage the animation speed for all the slides in the presentation.</p><h2 id="Part-3-FAQs-About-Change-PPT-Speed-3"><a href="#Part-3-FAQs-About-Change-PPT-Speed-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: FAQs About Change PPT Speed"></a>Part 3: FAQs About Change PPT Speed</h2><p><strong>Q1) Why is my video lagging in PowerPoint?</strong></p><p>There could be several reasons for this. Some of the common ones are listed below:</p><ul><li>You may have not configured the playback speed correctly (To fix this, go to the Windows Media Player Properties box as explained earlier, and configure various resolution and speed options accordingly)</li><li>Your GPU is old, and doesn’t support the resolution of the video clip (To fix this, go to File &gt; Info &gt; Compress Media and choose a lower resolution) (Choose Presentation Quality on the Microsoft PowerPoint 2010 – PowerPoint 2016 versions)</li><li>Hardware acceleration is turned off. (To fix this, go to File &gt; Options &gt; Advanced &gt; Display and uncheck the ‘Display Slide Show hardware graphics acceleration’ box)</li></ul><p><strong>Q2) Why I cannot insert video in PowerPoint?</strong></p><p>You may want to check if the video is of a compatible format. It would be good to use an MP4 video as it integrates seamlessly with most applications.</p><p><strong>Q3) Which video format is best for PowerPoint?</strong></p><p>Listed below are some of the formats that PowerPoint supports:</p><ul><li>*.asf</li><li>*.avi</li><li>*.mp4, *.m4v, *.mov</li><li>*.mpg, *.mpeg</li><li>*.wmv</li></ul><p>However, considering the popularity and compatibility, MP4 is the format that is suggested by many professionals.</p><p><strong>Q4) Why PowerPoint cannot play media?</strong></p><p>Some most common reasons for this issue include:</p><ul><li><strong>Incompatible Media</strong> – To fix this, go to File &gt; Info and click ‘Optimize Compatibility’ (The tile will automatically appear if the presentation has an incompatible media file)</li><li><strong>Unrecognized Format</strong> – To fix this, check if the format of the video is supported by PowerPoint. If not, consider using an effective converter like Wondershare UniConverter to convert the clip to a compatible format before importing</li><li><strong>Missing Codecs</strong> – To fix this, install the required codecs on your PC. Nevertheless, if you’re using an MP4 file, it is unlikely that you encounter such an issue</li><li><strong>Overly Populated ‘Temp’ Folder</strong> – To fix this, type <strong>%TEMP%</strong> in the search box, and press <strong>Enter</strong>. Now, press <strong>Ctrl</strong> + <strong>A</strong> to select all the contents, and hit <strong>Delete</strong> to get rid of them. Next, restart the computer and try again to see if the issue is fixed</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"
