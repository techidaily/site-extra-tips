The options available back then were very rudimentary compared to what we have at the present times, thanks to advancements in technology as well as the phenomenon growth in the photography industry. Not long ago, the term video camera was used to encompass just a handful of devices which all had similar characteristics. But nowadays, there are many types of video cameras at all budget levels, shapes and sizes and presented below is a quick overview of the types of video cameras available in the market today:</p><p> <strong><em>You may also like:</em></strong><br>_ <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Top 10 professional 360 degree cameras <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> _<br>_ <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >What is Frame Rate <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> _<br>_ <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >What Is Video Format <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> _</p><h2 id="1-Smartphone"><a href="#1-Smartphone" class="headerlink" title="1. Smartphone"></a>1. Smartphone</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-7-plus-dual-camera.jpg"                      alt="Smartphone video camera"                ></p><p> Smartphone with inbuilt video cameras are at the very bottom of video camera food chain. Most of the high-end Smartphones such as some Android, iPhone, and Nokia models have satisfactory video cameras capable of shooting high definition videos. Even though the Smartphone video cameras may not suffice the needs of individuals who are serious about film making, they are adequate enough for the average users who need to take videos and photos during instances such as family or social gatherings. With a growing set of apps and tools however, these cameras can now be equipped and made to operate like full size cameras capable of taking professional videos.</p><h2 id="2-Consumer-Video-Cameras"><a href="#2-Consumer-Video-Cameras" class="headerlink" title="2. Consumer Video Cameras"></a>2. Consumer Video Cameras</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/consumer-camera-image.jpg"                      alt="Consumer video camera"                ></p><p> Consumer video cameras refer to simple cameras designed for personal non-professional use. In most cases, these cameras are less expensive and can be bought in the range of <strong>$200</strong> to <strong>$1,500</strong> and they usually come with smaller imaging chips. The images from consumer video cameras are not as great in terms of quality as the images from a professional camera.</p><p> The other characteristic of consumer cameras is that they are smaller and simpler to operate, with most of them being fully automatic. But users still have the versatility to manually adjust other settings such as exposure audio level, focus and white balance amongst others. Unlike their professional counterparts, consumer cameras don’t have extensions to allow for extra audio inputs for professional sound equipment and all of them have fixed lenses with outdated digital revolution.</p><h2 id="3-Pro-Consumer-Video-Camera"><a href="#3-Pro-Consumer-Video-Camera" class="headerlink" title="3. Pro Consumer Video Camera"></a>3. Pro Consumer Video Camera</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/prosumer-video-camera.jpg"                      alt="Prosumer camera"                ></p><p> Next in the list are pro consumer video cameras. Pro consumer cameras lie in between consumer cameras and professional cameras. They are the cameras with smaller form factors than the larger cameras which are usually mounted on the shoulders for big budget TV production. However, the cameras are packed with enough features to grant professional image quality and are sufficient to do just any job.</p><p> Pro consumer video cameras are also fairly expensive and the decent ones range between $1500 and $10,000 – almost a third of what you could spend for fully professional cameras like those used for big budget television works. Despite the high price range and the kind of technology utilized in the manufacture of these cameras, they still come with manual image and audio controls and most of them have external audio inputs.</p><p> The other admirable thing about these cameras is that they offer bigger imaging chips, interchangeable lenses, as well as the versatility to be time code in and out in instances of multi-camera reporting. With all the features and capabilities of these cameras, it becomes really difficult to distinguish them as either pro consumer cameras or professional cameras. Perhaps the most glaring difference between the two sets of cameras is the price. For professional video cameras, you can expect to spend anywhere from $8,000 well up to the regions of $50,000 and sometimes beyond.</p><h2 id="4-Super-Chip-Cameras"><a href="#4-Super-Chip-Cameras" class="headerlink" title="4. Super Chip Cameras"></a>4. Super Chip Cameras</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/super-chip-camera.jpg"                      alt="Super chip video cameras"                ></p><p> Yet again, there is a set of cameras in between the pro consumer cameras and the professional cameras and we prefer to call them super chip cameras. These cameras are characterized by three distinct factors below:</p><ul><li>Super chip cameras all have imaging chips which are larger than traditional pro video cameras. The imaging chips in these cameras are two to three times bigger than those in traditional pro video cameras.</li><li>The second factor distinguishing the super chip video cameras is the fact that they come with interchangeable lenses.</li><li>The third distinguishing factor is the price of the super chip cameras.</li></ul><p> Super chip cameras are primarily packed with big chips and professional features and they are also relatively affordable than the professional cameras. The cost of super chip cameras could be anywhere between <strong>$6,000</strong> and <strong>$20,000</strong>. Some examples of the super chip cameras include some brands of Sony, Cannons Compact and the powerful Panasonic F100 video camera.</p><p> These cameras have the capability to do everything that a traditional program could do, but with the added advantage of achieving the same tasks at relatively affordable rates. They are also ideal for high-end freelance broadcast work and film making.</p><h2 id="5-DSLR-Video-Cameras"><a href="#5-DSLR-Video-Cameras" class="headerlink" title="5. DSLR Video Cameras"></a>5. DSLR Video Cameras</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dslr-camera-full-rig.jpg"                      alt="DRSL video camera"                ></p><p> DSLR (Digital Single Lens Reflex) is basically digital photo camera fitted with the ability to take high quality HD videos. The popularity of these cameras has grown in the past few years due to three outstanding characteristics below common to all DSLR cameras:</p><ul><li>They have big imaging chips which lead to high quality images.</li><li>They have interchangeable lenses which allow for more creative flexibility, making it possible for you to use first-class lenses if you can afford.</li><li>DSLR cameras are affordable. For instance, with about $3,000 you can purchase a DSLR camera with double image quality considering that this is half of what you would have paid for a dedicated pro consumer video camera.</li></ul><p> At the look of things, it may appear that DSLR cameras is the way to go, considering its features as well as the fact that they are more affordable. However, there are certain limitations you may not like about them. For instance, DSLR cameras are still photo cameras. They were never designed for video and this was an afterthought in their design.</p><p> Again, you will be disappointed to learn that most of the important features presented even on the low video cameras are missing in these cameras. The features absent in DLSR include manual audio control, zebra stripes for judging exposure, speaking to judge focus, and motorized zoom.</p><p> Additionally, DSLR cameras don’t have an XLR audio inputs to allow the use of professional mics and mixes and they also have a limited recording time of just 12 minutes per clip and this is not very encouraging if you are in the middle of recording someone’s wedding vows. Even though there are a number of workarounds and third party applications to help in overcoming these shortcomings, they will only add to the cost and complications of DSLR shooting.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/breaking-language-barriers-with-these-top-20-video-translators-for-2024/"><u>Breaking Language Barriers with These Top 20 Video Translators for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/twilight-tales-top-hdr-sky-captures-from-leading-portals/"><u>Twilight Tales - Top HDR Sky Captures From Leading Portals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/unraveling-the-top-8-premium-free-srt-translation-websites/"><u>Unraveling the Top 8 Premium Free SRT Translation Websites</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/the-art-of-drafting-alluring-vlog-show-content/"><u>The Art of Drafting Alluring Vlog Show Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/age-old-artwork-free-from-modern-constraints/"><u>Age-Old Artwork  Free From Modern Constraints</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/master-the-craft-powerdirector-2024-complete-guide-and-reviews/"><u>Master the Craft  PowerDirector 2024 Complete Guide & Reviews</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/updated-10-innovative-skin-modification-apps-for-smartphones/"><u>[Updated] 10 Innovative Skin Modification Apps for Smartphones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/critical-top-5-minute-tight-video-capturers-guide/"><u>Critical Top 5 Minute-Tight Video Capturers Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-types-of-facebook-video-aspect-ratios-and-how-to-adjust-it/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Types of Facebook Video Aspect Ratios & How to Adjust It</u></a></li><li><a href="https://bypass-frp.techidaily.com/how-to-bypass-google-frp-lock-from-vivo-g2-devices-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Bypass Google FRP Lock from Vivo G2 Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/mastering-streaming-ranked-guide-to-27-platforms-excluding-youtube-for-2024/"><u>Mastering Streaming  Ranked Guide to 27 Platforms Excluding Youtube for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://animation-videos.techidaily.com/new-10-realistic-cartoon-characters-you-would-run-away-from-if-you-met-in-real-life-for-2024/"><u>New 10 Realistic Cartoon Characters You Would Run Away From if You Met in Real Life for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/different-methods-to-unlock-your-apple-iphone-6s-plus-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Different Methods To Unlock Your Apple iPhone 6s Plus | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/mastering-youtube-video-edits-with-finalcut-pro-for-2024/"><u>Mastering YouTube Video Edits with FinalCut Pro for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-editing.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-online-learning-module-a-complete-overview/"><u>New In 2024, Online Learning Module A Complete Overview</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-how-to-record-webcam-and-screen-simultaneously/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, How to Record Webcam and Screen Simultaneously</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-affordable-subscriber-boost-buy-and-sell-youtube-views-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Affordable Subscriber Boost  Buy & Sell YouTube Views for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Various image attributes such as contrast, color, saturation, detail, black level, and white point can be enhanced whether it is movies, videos, or still images.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-color-grading"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-color-grading" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is color grading?"></a>Part 1. What is color grading?</h2><p>Color grading is the process of stylizing the color scheme of your footage by “painting” over what you’ve created using color correction. After the colorist completes the color correction, they can begin the process of grading the footage. During color grading, colorists use editing software to stylize the shot – emphasizing the visual tone and atmosphere of the film and making it look more cinematic.</p><p>Color sorting can be used for both technical and creative changes. Colorists use color gradation for artistic purposes to ensure that a film’s carefully selected color palette conveys a specific atmosphere, style, or emotion. For example, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0169547/"><em>American Beauty (1999)</em></a> uses redder in dramatic moments to represent passion, anger, and power, whereas <a class="link"   href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1587310/" >_Maleficent (2014) _ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> uses green to represent danger, corruption, and darkness.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/color-grading-tutorial-1.jpg"                      alt="color grading tutorial"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-11-best-Color-Correction-and-Color-Grading-Tutorial"><a href="#Part-2-11-best-Color-Correction-and-Color-Grading-Tutorial" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 11 best Color Correction and Color Grading Tutorial"></a>Part 2. 11 best Color Correction and Color Grading Tutorial</h2><h3 id="1-Color-correction-and-grading-in-Premiere-Pro-2021"><a href="#1-Color-correction-and-grading-in-Premiere-Pro-2021" class="headerlink" title="1.

The home page is a list of templates of various genres and themes and you may find that it is quite a chore to find the unique template that you would like to use.</p><h2 id="ImgFlip-Meme-Template"><a href="#ImgFlip-Meme-Template" class="headerlink" title="ImgFlip Meme Template"></a>ImgFlip Meme Template</h2><p>If you are not looking to create highly sophisticated memes, ImgFlip is a great simple solution that you can use. There are thousands of meme templates to choose from, arranged in various genres and themes. Since the templates are added every day, the site has a very convenient search function that you can use to find the most reliable meme for your project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/imgflip-meme-template.jpg"                      alt="imgflip meme template"                ></p><p>But ImgFlip is not a complete photos editor, meaning that you may not able to change the template too much. The only thing you can do with this tool is to change the caption o the template which can be valuable if you find the right meme template. Once the caption has been added, you can then download the completed meme and then upload it to various social media sites.</p><h2 id="Wepik-Meme-Templates"><a href="#Wepik-Meme-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Wepik Meme Templates"></a>Wepik Meme Templates</h2><p>Wepik is another great site if you are looking for different types of memes to use. There are thousands of memes that you can choose from and they are updated every day, giving you a wide variety of choices. The most popular and the newest meme templates are available on the first page, but you can also use the search function to find a particular meme template that may not be on the home page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/wepik-meme-templates.jpg"                      alt="wepik meme templates"                ></p><p>Once you have selected the meme that you want to use, Wepik shows you details about the template you have chosen.

Once you are happy with the changes, you can then download the meme to post to your social media pages.</p><h2 id="Knowledge-of-Meme-Templates"><a href="#Knowledge-of-Meme-Templates" class="headerlink" title="Knowledge of Meme Templates"></a>Knowledge of Meme Templates</h2><p><strong>1. Copyright of Free Meme Templates</strong></p><p>Like every other type of content that you may see online, memes (even free meme templates) are copyrighted. But the reason you don’t hear about this is that meme copyright infringement is rarely enforced. Memes are relatively easy to create and cost next to nothing so pursuing litigation in copyright infringement may not be worth the cost. They are also widely available and it is difficult to figure out where they originated from.</p><p>If you are worried about the legal implications of using a free meme template, you can credit the creator of the meme whenever you use it. But because it can often be difficult to find out who created the meme, this may be very difficult. The only way to overcome these legal challenges may be to use some of the meme templates on this page to create your own meme that will be unique to you.</p><p><strong>2.

This guide will tell you everything you need to know about how to configure the best computer for 4K editing, all by yourself. 4K videos are becoming popular, and give significantly more details when compared to the current standard of 1080p. Editing 4K videos require higher specifications than the standard computers used by an average person. Read along to know what exactly you need in a PC to do the job.</p><h4 id="1-CPU-the-Faster-the-Better"><a href="#1-CPU-the-Faster-the-Better" class="headerlink" title="1.  CPU- the Faster, the Better"></a>1.  CPU- the Faster, the Better</h4><p>The CPU, that is, the processor of your computer is the first thing you would want to look at while building a PC for any purpose on this Earth! It this unit which will load the OS (Operating System), run all the programs and make all the calculations. So, basically, how efficiently and quickly you can perform the editing mostly depends on the CPU. Its speed is largely determined by the clock speed, which is measure in GigaHertz (GhZ). If you have a limited budget, go for AMD Ryzen 5 CPU (estimated price: $250 - $280) which has 6 cores and 12 threads. The i9 7900X CPU ($1250 - $1300) with a whopping 10 cores and 20 threads is the fastest CPU out there for video editing.</p><p><strong>What to see in a CPU?</strong></p><ul><li>The clock speed- the higher, the better</li><li>Number of cores- The bigger, the better</li><li>Socket- Must be compatible with your motherboard</li><li>Cache, memory bandwidth and other factors.</li></ul><h4 id="2-The-GPU-or-the-Graphics-Card-Not-Essential-but-Highly-Recommended"><a href="#2-The-GPU-or-the-Graphics-Card-Not-Essential-but-Highly-Recommended" class="headerlink" title="2.  The GPU or the Graphics Card- Not Essential but Highly Recommended"></a>2.  The GPU or the Graphics Card- Not Essential but Highly Recommended</h4><p>If you have a very fast CPU, it is not absolutely necessary that you get a GPU for your 4K editing computer. However, having a good GPU will make a lot of difference. It relieves the CPU from performing graphic intensive tasks, and is specially designed to do that. Some software largely depend on the GPU or the graphics card for encoding and rendering, although a lot of other software will run quite smoothly if you have cheap graphics card or even if there isn’t any. For lower budgets, the GTX 1050 ($175 - $200) is recommended. If, however, you have a serious budget, go for an NVIDIA card from the 900 series (around $330). The highest performance cards are GTX 1080Ti $910-$980) and the Titan Xp ($1950). It is not recommended to spend too much on GPU unless you know you are dealing with highly graphics intensive job.</p><p><strong>Things to keep in mind:</strong></p><ul><li>Don’t spend too much.</li><li>Consider your CPU.</li><li>Consider your software.</li></ul><h4 id="3-The-Random-Access-Memory-RAM-The-More-the-Better"><a href="#3-The-Random-Access-Memory-RAM-The-More-the-Better" class="headerlink" title="3.  The Random Access Memory (RAM)- The More, the Better"></a>3.  The Random Access Memory (RAM)- The More, the Better</h4><p>Generally speaking, RAM is the memory available to the programs- it is where they are loaded. For 4K editing, you will need some 16 GB of Ram to keep it nice and smooth. It is very critical that you get sufficient memory for you editing software. Be comfortable while investing in RAM as video editing software use a lot of it.</p><p><strong>What is VRAM?</strong></p><p>Well, VRAM and RAM, although sound alike, are pretty different in functioning. A VRAM (Video RAM) basically works with the GPU by focusing on storing graphic data. The VRAM will see how many 3D and D images can be displayed simultaneously.</p><p><strong>How to choose the perfect RAM</strong></p><ul><li>Size: Minimum 8 GB for 4K editing, 4GB for 1080p</li><li>Kind of RAM (DDR2, DDR3, DDR4): Determines compatibility with motherboard</li><li>Other Factors: Speed (MHz), Timing (Latency), etc.</li></ul><h4 id="4-Storage"><a href="#4-Storage" class="headerlink" title="4.  Storage"></a>4.  Storage</h4><p>When it comes to storage, you have two broad options to choose from: HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) and SSDs (Solid State Drives). While HDDs use physical spinning discs to write and read data, there are memory chips in solid state drives that store data. SDDs are way faster than HDDs, but quite intuitively, more expensive. The ideal media storage is three to four times the expected size of a project’s source footage.</p><p>Key factors while determining storage for 4K editing software include:</p><ul><li>Spin speed: Should not be less than 7200 rpm for smooth 4K video editing</li><li>Type: SDDs are faster, (and expensive), not necessary but small SDD storage recommended for OS and important software</li></ul><h4 id="5-Motherboard"><a href="#5-Motherboard" class="headerlink" title="5.  Motherboard"></a>5.  Motherboard</h4><p>The motherboard is the central piece of your system that connects every component of the PC. The most important thing while selecting the motherboard for any PC remains the compatibility check. Your CPU must (absolutely must) be compatible with the motherboard. Do make sure the motherboard uses same socket as the CPU for your computer to work. For instance, the latest intel i-series chips, the i3, i5 and i7 have the LGA 1151 socket, so you want a motherboard compatible with LGA 1151.</p><p><strong>Things to see in a motherboard</strong></p><ul><li>Socket</li><li>High quality integrated sound (You don’t want to deal with the complexity of sound cards)</li><li>Number of 3.0 USB ports</li><li>Number of SATA connections supported (for storage)</li></ul><h4 id="6-Display-Monitor"><a href="#6-Display-Monitor" class="headerlink" title="6.  Display (Monitor)"></a>6.  Display (Monitor)</h4><p>Again, 4K monitors aren’t necessary, but always a plus. They allow you to visualise more clearly the changes and the effects, once you are done editing and provide a lot of space to work on. And, with 4K becoming the new standard, it would be great if you have 4K TV!</p><h4 id="7-Video-editing-software"><a href="#7-Video-editing-software" class="headerlink" title="7.  Video editing software"></a>7.  Video editing software</h4><p>So, which video editing software to use?</p><p>There is a host of software available for video editing. But, not all of them will support 4K video editing. Here is a list of top 4K editing software.</p><p>Note: This list does not indicate a ranking or order of preference.</p><p>1.<a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>: it performs better on the various graphics processor, RAM, or Disk. Here are the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4k editing system requirements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p>2.Adobe Premiere Pro CC</p><p>3.Sony Movie Studio 3 Platinum</p><p>4.Sony Vega Pro 13</p><p>5.Apple Final Cut Pro X2</p><p>6.Cyberlink Power Director 13 Ultra</p><p>7.Apple iMovie</p><p>Make sure you select the software that your computer will support, i.e., you have the minimum system requirements for the chosen software.</p><p>And that’s it! Now you can build the best computer for 4K video editing that will suit your requirements, fit in your budget, and most importantly, will be tailored for your job! While there are so many pre-built computers configured especially for 4K video editing, a lot of them will hurt your pocket a lot and will be loaded with too many features that you may never need.

The “Lasso&#x2F;Polygonal Lasso” tool can help manually draw areas for your selection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/edit-blur-or-remove-photo-background-3.jpg"                      alt="edit the image edges"                ></p><p>Step 4: Remove Residual Colors</p><p>From the panel at the right, select “Output Settings.” Check the box next to “Decontaminate Colors” to get rid of any leftover color fringe from your foreground.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Discovering-the-Perfect-Shape-Tailoring-Aspect-Ratios-in-Videos"><a href="#Discovering-the-Perfect-Shape-Tailoring-Aspect-Ratios-in-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Discovering the Perfect Shape: Tailoring Aspect Ratios in Videos"></a>Discovering the Perfect Shape: Tailoring Aspect Ratios in Videos</h2><p>Video aspect ratios are changing depending on which platform you are using. Knowing the characteristics about aspect ratios is crucial to accomplish the ideal visual appeal across any platform.</p><p>If you want to learn more about video aspect ratios, how to apply them to different social media platforms, then you are in the right place! This article will explain what a video aspect ratio is, it includes common video aspect ratios you see nowadays, and includes recommended aspect ratios for video on various social media platforms.</p><p>With that said, let’s dive right into it!</p><h2 id="1-What-is-a-video-aspect-ratio"><a href="#1-What-is-a-video-aspect-ratio" class="headerlink" title="1. What is a video aspect ratio?"></a>1. What is a video aspect ratio?</h2><p>Aspect ratio is a digital image projection attribute describing the distance between the width and the height of an image. The dimensions are also defined as shapes such as a square which is 4:3. A rectangle represents the 16:9 standard high definition aspect ratio, and inverted what you see on phones, that will be 9:16. 9 refers to the width and 16 to the height.</p><h2 id="2-Commonly-used-aspect-ratios"><a href="#2-Commonly-used-aspect-ratios" class="headerlink" title="2. Commonly used aspect ratios"></a>2. Commonly used aspect ratios</h2><p>There is no same aspect ratio that is used across all social media platforms. Depending on which social media platform you are planning to upload, you have to make sure you have the correct aspect ratio for your target audience. The optimal viewing experience is what matters.</p><h3 id="16-9-Widescreen"><a href="#16-9-Widescreen" class="headerlink" title="16:9 Widescreen"></a>16:9 Widescreen</h3><p>This aspect ratio is recognized as the worldwide reference format for film, mobile devides, DSLR cameras, streaming platforms, social media platforms, and many more. It is known as landscape viewing which include 720p, 1080p HD and 4K resolution.</p><h3 id="4-3-Standard"><a href="#4-3-Standard" class="headerlink" title="4:3 Standard"></a>4:3 Standard</h3><p>This resolution is originally used in older television screens, which transformed into mobile use as this aspect ratio works really well for Instagram and Facebook videos, referring to the 9:16 phone resolution making a square video more pleasant to watch and to be featured in in-feed videos.</p><h3 id="9-16-Vertical"><a href="#9-16-Vertical" class="headerlink" title="9:16 Vertical"></a>9:16 Vertical</h3><p>The 9:16 aspect ratio has become the mainstream resolution for smartphones for easier viewing of videos. This resolution allows for the vertical display of videos on tablets and phones, meaning that it allows videos to play while the device is being held in its upright position. This works ideally for Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube Shorts, and more.</p><h3 id="21-9-Cinematic-Widescreen"><a href="#21-9-Cinematic-Widescreen" class="headerlink" title="21:9 Cinematic Widescreen"></a>21:9 Cinematic Widescreen</h3><p>The 21:9 resolution is designed for filming ultra-wide screen movies that gives the viewer a theater-like feeling. It’s mostly used to display films and movies in anamorphic formats. Just like on ultra-wide monitors, it allows the video to be shown across the entire screen, giving you a cinema-like experience. This resolution contributes to a broader viewing experience in any shape or form.</p><h2 id="3-Which-aspect-ratio-should-I-choose"><a href="#3-Which-aspect-ratio-should-I-choose" class="headerlink" title="3. Which aspect ratio should I choose?"></a>3. Which aspect ratio should I choose?</h2><p>Depending on your project, broadcast location and filming options, here you can find an overview of which platforms are using which resolutions and how you can use that to improve your filming and viewer experience.</p><h3 id="Facebook"><a href="#Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Facebook"></a>Facebook</h3><p>Facebook is one of the most used website across the world on both computer and the mobile app. This is a great platform to let people discover your content. In order to please new viewers, let’s look at the resolutions Facebook supports and which one would be your best option depending on your content.</p><p>4:3 or 1:1 for Facebook feed videos</p><p>16:9 for in-stream ads on Facebook</p><p>9:16 for Facebook live videos</p><p>9:16 for Facebook stories</p><h3 id="YouTube"><a href="#YouTube" class="headerlink" title="YouTube"></a>YouTube</h3><p>To this day, it’s safe to say that YouTube is the leading platform in the video industry. Not only because of how long they have been around, but also about how much content is uploaded every minute and how many users it has each month. To give the viewers the best experience, here are the top aspect ratios we recommend when posting content onto your YouTube channel.</p><p>16:9 for YouTube live streams</p><p>9:16 for YouTube Shorts</p><p>16:9 for regular HD videos</p><p>21:9 for cinematic videos&#x2F;shortfilms</p><h3 id="Instagram"><a href="#Instagram" class="headerlink" title="Instagram"></a>Instagram</h3><p>When talking about Instagram, which is very similar to Facebook, use these aspect ratios to ensure that your quality will be the best of the best.</p><p>9:16 for Instagram Reels</p><p>4:3 for Instagram feed advertisements</p><p>9:16 for Instagram Story advertisements</p><p>9:16 for Instagram Stories</p><p>4:3 or 1:1 for Instagram feed videos</p><p>9:16 for Instagram Live streams</p><p>9:16 for IGTV</p><h3 id="TikTok"><a href="#TikTok" class="headerlink" title="TikTok"></a>TikTok</h3><p>Before Musical.ly users were migrated to a new platform called TikTok in 2018, it has been the leader on the board for a long time, and here are the recommended resolutions we think give the best results. Tik Tok allows you to share short videos, and is used by young people as an outlet to show their talents whether it’s dancing, singing, cooking, comedy or any other form of entertainment they can express and use on the platform. There’s also a feature to work together and collaborate with other Tik Tok creators across the globe.</p><p>16:9 for organic Tik Tok feed videos</p><p>16:9 for Tik Tok live videos</p><p>1:1; 16:9 or 9:16 for TikTok advertisements</p><h2 id="4-How-to-adjust-the-aspect-ratio-of-a-video"><a href="#4-How-to-adjust-the-aspect-ratio-of-a-video" class="headerlink" title="4. How to adjust the aspect ratio of a video?"></a>4. How to adjust the aspect ratio of a video?</h2><p>A very important point we’d like to mention is that we don’t recommend changing the aspect ratio after filming, because it could harm the video quality and we think it’s best to choose the aspect ratio on your phone or camera before filming, besides that we have some great tips for optimizing your video for the watching experience below.</p><h3 id="Black-bars"><a href="#Black-bars" class="headerlink" title="Black bars"></a>Black bars</h3><p>When editing your video, adding black bars is not changing the aspect ratio as you are just adding black bars to the screen. What we do recommend is cropping the video until you get the desired result.

Do you want to fade in or out your video to black or white? Then, we have got you. Adobe Premiere Pro is one popular video editing software. Fading is every editor’s trump card, making it enjoyable to viewers by seamless scene transitions and some elements pop onto the screen. Fading is an effortless and beautiful effect that hep the clips to merge into the color of another clip smoothly. It is a way of telling viewers there is a visual change without explicitly telling them. The fade effect is in two forms fade in and fade out. Moreover, Fade-in appears at the beginning of the video and fade-out at the end of the video. And in this blog, we will discuss how to fade in Premiere Pro.</p><p>A fade-in refers to the technique that allows video&#x2F;image to emerge from the black, white, or any color background. In contrast, fade-out relates to the methods which will enable videos&#x2F;images to blend naturally into the black, white, or color background. We will also learn how to fade in video Premiere Pro.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Fade Video Transition Premiere Pro](#Part 1)</p><p>02 [Fade In&#x2F;Out sound on Premiere Pro](#Part 2)</p><p>03 [Add Video fade in Premiere Pro](#Part 3)</p><h2 id="Part-1-Fade-Video-Transition-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part-1-Fade-Video-Transition-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Fade Video Transition Premiere Pro"></a>Part 1 Fade Video Transition Premiere Pro</h2><p>Premiere Pro to add fade transition can be between clips to link and move from one shot to another shot smoothly. Premiere Pro offers many transition effects to edit the videos: Audio, Video, and VR.</p><p>Transitions are generally of two types; single-sided or double-sided transitions. Single-sided is when you have only a single clip. This image shows how the transition fades look. The double-sided transition will have a diagonal line, and the single-sided transition will have one-half light and the other half dark.</p><h5 id="Step1-Apply-Transition-between-the-clips"><a href="#Step1-Apply-Transition-between-the-clips" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Apply Transition between the clips"></a>Step1 Apply Transition between the clips</h5><p>Initially, you need to apply the transition to add fading effects. First, choose Window &gt; Effects. Expand the video or audio transitions, expand the bin containing the transition, and drag and drop the required transition between the two clips.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/apply-transition.jpg"                      alt="apply transition"                ></p><h5 id="Step2-Single-Sided-Transitions"><a href="#Step2-Single-Sided-Transitions" class="headerlink" title="Step2 Single-Sided Transitions"></a>Step2 Single-Sided Transitions</h5><p>When you place the transition on a single cut, click on Ctrl + drag on the transition to the timeline. Release the mouse when the “End at Cut” or “Start at Cut” icon appears.</p><p>End At Cut: Adjust the end transition at the end of the first clip</p><p>Start At Cut: Adjust the start of the transition at the beginning of the first clip. This is another method to add fade in the Premiere.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/start-and-end.jpg"                      alt="start and end"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-Fade-In-Out-sound-on-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part-2-Fade-In-Out-sound-on-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 Fade In&#x2F;Out sound on Premiere Pro"></a>Part 2 Fade In&#x2F;Out sound on Premiere Pro</h2><p>Are you in doubt about how to fade background music in Premiere Pro? A crossfade is an essential tool for smooth video effects where viewers cannot notice any cuts between the videos, which can be valuable for both video and audio. There are two types of crossfading, either by using keyframes manually or using transitions pre-built in Premiere Pro.</p><p>Let’s learn how to add crossfade in Premiere. There are three types of crossfade available in the Premiere: constant gain, constant power, and exponential power to fade music. Lets us discuss how to add music fade in Premiere Pro.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/types-of-crossfade.jpg"                      alt="types of crossfade"                ></p><p>You can find these options in Effects &gt; Audio Transitions &gt; Crossfade available in the project panel. This is how to add a crossfade in Premiere with just three simple steps. There are three types of crossfade available in Premiere Pro, and below is a brief description of them.</p><h3 id="Constant-Gain"><a href="#Constant-Gain" class="headerlink" title="Constant Gain"></a>Constant Gain</h3><p>The constant gain crossfades are employed to vary the audio at a constant rate as it fades in and fades out at the transition between the clips. But sometimes, it is often abrupt. These are usually done manually using keyframes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/constant-gain.jpg"                      alt="constant gain"                ></p><p>But this constant gain generally seems to be noise and not smooth compared to continuous power. Let us discuss this next.</p><h3 id="Constant-Power"><a href="#Constant-Power" class="headerlink" title="Constant Power"></a>Constant Power</h3><p>Constant Power crossfade creates a smooth, gradual transition effect analogous to dissolve to the following clip compared to constant gain. Constant power fades in the audio effect initially and then fades out at the end of the clip. In the image, you can notice the keyframes have gradually decreased in the first clip and steadily increased at the end of the second clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/constant-power.jpg"                      alt="constant power"                ></p><p>Compared to all other crossfades, constant power is the best audio crossfade. This will be giving a more smoothing effect and gradual shift in gain between the clips, nothing more apparent changes during the transition. This is how to fade in sound on Premiere Pro using constant power crossfade.</p><h3 id="Exponential-Fade"><a href="#Exponential-Fade" class="headerlink" title="Exponential Fade"></a>Exponential Fade</h3><p>Exponential Fade is opposite to constant power. It fades out the first clip and disappears in the second clip, which brings a smooth logarithmic curve. This is how to add exponential Fade in Premiere Pro to the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/exponential-fade.jpg"                      alt="exponential fade"                ></p><p>Thus, now you know how to add crossfade in Premiere Pro smoothly.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Add-Video-fade-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part-3-Add-Video-fade-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Add Video fade in Premiere Pro"></a>Part 3 Add Video fade in Premiere Pro</h2><p>When we want to add a black color between two videos for smooth movements, the best idea is to fade-in and fade-out.

Premiere Pro offers many transition effects to edit the videos: Audio, Video, and VR.</p><p>Transitions are generally of two types; single-sided or double-sided transitions. Single-sided is when you have only a single clip. This image shows how the transition fades look. The double-sided transition will have a diagonal line, and the single-sided transition will have one-half light and the other half dark.</p><h5 id="Step1-Apply-Transition-between-the-clips-1"><a href="#Step1-Apply-Transition-between-the-clips-1" class="headerlink" title="Step1 Apply Transition between the clips"></a>Step1 Apply Transition between the clips</h5><p>Initially, you need to apply the transition to add fading effects.

A crossfade is an essential tool for smooth video effects where viewers cannot notice any cuts between the videos, which can be valuable for both video and audio. There are two types of crossfading, either by using keyframes manually or using transitions pre-built in Premiere Pro.</p><p>Let’s learn how to add crossfade in Premiere. There are three types of crossfade available in the Premiere: constant gain, constant power, and exponential power to fade music. Lets us discuss how to add music fade in Premiere Pro.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/types-of-crossfade.jpg"                      alt="types of crossfade"                ></p><p>You can find these options in Effects &gt; Audio Transitions &gt; Crossfade available in the project panel. This is how to add a crossfade in Premiere with just three simple steps. There are three types of crossfade available in Premiere Pro, and below is a brief description of them.</p><h3 id="Constant-Gain-1"><a href="#Constant-Gain-1" class="headerlink" title="Constant Gain"></a>Constant Gain</h3><p>The constant gain crossfades are employed to vary the audio at a constant rate as it fades in and fades out at the transition between the clips. But sometimes, it is often abrupt. These are usually done manually using keyframes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/constant-gain.jpg"                      alt="constant gain"                ></p><p>But this constant gain generally seems to be noise and not smooth compared to continuous power. Let us discuss this next.</p><h3 id="Constant-Power-1"><a href="#Constant-Power-1" class="headerlink" title="Constant Power"></a>Constant Power</h3><p>Constant Power crossfade creates a smooth, gradual transition effect analogous to dissolve to the following clip compared to constant gain. Constant power fades in the audio effect initially and then fades out at the end of the clip. In the image, you can notice the keyframes have gradually decreased in the first clip and steadily increased at the end of the second clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/constant-power.jpg"                      alt="constant power"                ></p><p>Compared to all other crossfades, constant power is the best audio crossfade. This will be giving a more smoothing effect and gradual shift in gain between the clips, nothing more apparent changes during the transition. This is how to fade in sound on Premiere Pro using constant power crossfade.</p><h3 id="Exponential-Fade-1"><a href="#Exponential-Fade-1" class="headerlink" title="Exponential Fade"></a>Exponential Fade</h3><p>Exponential Fade is opposite to constant power. It fades out the first clip and disappears in the second clip, which brings a smooth logarithmic curve. This is how to add exponential Fade in Premiere Pro to the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/exponential-fade.jpg"                      alt="exponential fade"                ></p><p>Thus, now you know how to add crossfade in Premiere Pro smoothly.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Add-Video-fade-in-Premiere-Pro-1"><a href="#Part-3-Add-Video-fade-in-Premiere-Pro-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Add Video fade in Premiere Pro"></a>Part 3 Add Video fade in Premiere Pro</h2><p>When we want to add a black color between two videos for smooth movements, the best idea is to fade-in and fade-out.

There are three types of crossfade available in Premiere Pro, and below is a brief description of them.</p><h3 id="Constant-Gain-2"><a href="#Constant-Gain-2" class="headerlink" title="Constant Gain"></a>Constant Gain</h3><p>The constant gain crossfades are employed to vary the audio at a constant rate as it fades in and fades out at the transition between the clips. But sometimes, it is often abrupt. These are usually done manually using keyframes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/constant-gain.jpg"                      alt="constant gain"                ></p><p>But this constant gain generally seems to be noise and not smooth compared to continuous power. Let us discuss this next.</p><h3 id="Constant-Power-2"><a href="#Constant-Power-2" class="headerlink" title="Constant Power"></a>Constant Power</h3><p>Constant Power crossfade creates a smooth, gradual transition effect analogous to dissolve to the following clip compared to constant gain. Constant power fades in the audio effect initially and then fades out at the end of the clip. In the image, you can notice the keyframes have gradually decreased in the first clip and steadily increased at the end of the second clip.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/constant-power.jpg"                      alt="constant power"                ></p><p>Compared to all other crossfades, constant power is the best audio crossfade. This will be giving a more smoothing effect and gradual shift in gain between the clips, nothing more apparent changes during the transition. This is how to fade in sound on Premiere Pro using constant power crossfade.</p><h3 id="Exponential-Fade-2"><a href="#Exponential-Fade-2" class="headerlink" title="Exponential Fade"></a>Exponential Fade</h3><p>Exponential Fade is opposite to constant power. It fades out the first clip and disappears in the second clip, which brings a smooth logarithmic curve. This is how to add exponential Fade in Premiere Pro to the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/exponential-fade.jpg"                      alt="exponential fade"                ></p><p>Thus, now you know how to add crossfade in Premiere Pro smoothly.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Add-Video-fade-in-Premiere-Pro-2"><a href="#Part-3-Add-Video-fade-in-Premiere-Pro-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Add Video fade in Premiere Pro"></a>Part 3 Add Video fade in Premiere Pro</h2><p>When we want to add a black color between two videos for smooth movements, the best idea is to fade-in and fade-out. In Premiere Pro, you will not find a fade option directly. It will appear as Film Dissolve in the settings of the Premiere Pro dashboard.

So iON Air Pro can be rated as a good choice for surfing needs but when it comes to diving then you have to look at GoPro.<br> The package includes decent accessories such as universal power adapter, USB cable and mounts. Even if you want to buy few additional accessories then they can be obtained with much cheaper price tag as compared to GoPro collections. The mount upgrade options include surfboards, handle bars and headbands. On the front side you will find a f2.8 fog free lens with 16 mm dimensions.</li><li><strong>Video and Photo Quality:</strong><br> The iON Air Pro 3 device can serve users with 1080p resolution level at 30 fps frame rate settings. The maximum supported bit rate with this mode is 12 Mbps. You can easily switch to 720p with 120 fps, 30fps and 60 fps frame rate settings where bit rate increases up to 22 Mbps. The best thing to know is its ability to record a secondary thumbnail at WQVGA resolution level during 1080p resolution setting, this file can be easily uploaded on internet and can be shared immediately with other devices. In case if you are working with remote application then supported resolution settings are 720p&#x2F;30fps and 1080p&#x2F; 30 fps, the mode gets automatically selected depending upon resolution switch position. Videos can be easily captured at 160 degree wide angle type view. Further, it can be adjusted to obtain little tighter details with 140 and 150 degree focus. This fixed focus type lens is best from 3.3 feet and ranges perfectly up to infinity thus you need to maintain proper space between subject and camera.<br> It can capture stills at 12Mp and 5MP resolution level while serving with 4:3 aspect ratio. Users can prefer to switch between time lapse and burst modes with interval selection of 60, 30. 10, 5 and 2 for the first case and 10 shot type settings in case of burst mode.</li><li><strong>Wi-Fi and Application:</strong><br> It is much simpler to access Wi-Fi settings with this device. Switch on your device as well as the Wi-Fi Podz then move to Wi-Fi setting of your tablet or smart phone. Here also select Podz from your network and then add password. The settings part is over and now you can control your device from remote location easily.

With 1080p resolution level it can record easily up to 2.5 hours. On the other side, the supported Micro SD card goes up to 64 GB capacity. Thus you can easily store a shoot of 4 hours 20 minute length if working on 1080p at 60 fps rating. Additionally, you will be able to obtain 8GB additional space from MiMedia that can be easily used for sharing videos or photos online.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p> This bullet shaped camera is right option for you if you are searching for something having features close to Toshiba or GoPro designs. The Wi-Fi PODZ adds flexibility to controls and accessibility. As the box include only few basic mounts so you may have to spend little extra to get the remaining ones from market. This device is best rated for helmet mount needs. The excellent video quality along with ease of operation and wide angle focus make it first choice under affordable action cam model category. You don’t need to spend on a waterproof case but apps are yet to be improved to enhance flexibility.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/max-wales-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Max Wales</p><p>Max Wales is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Max Wales</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-complete-visualization-with-giroptic-cam/"><u>2024 Approved  Complete Visualization with Giroptic Cam</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/comprehensive-lg-bp350-monitor-review-with-comparisons/"><u>Comprehensive LG BP350 Monitor Review with Comparisons</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/master-pip-feature-while-consuming-youtube-videos-on-iphones/"><u>Master PIP Feature While Consuming YouTube Videos on iPhones</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/ultimate-digital-collage-creator-8x/"><u>Ultimate Digital Collage Creator 8X</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-aurora-hdr-superior-or-subpar-imaging/"><u>2024 Approved  Aurora HDR  Superior or Subpar Imaging?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/iphone-x876-owners-must-have-gif-apps-guide/"><u>IPhone X/8/7/6 Owners' Must-Have GIF Apps Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/ultimate-selection-of-economical-4k-projection-screens/"><u>Ultimate Selection of Economical 4K Projection Screens</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/updated-break-the-monotony-with-these-6-captivating-videos/"><u>[Updated] Break the Monotony with These 6 Captivating Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/new-crafting-quieter-sounds-a-garageband-expertise/"><u>[New] Crafting Quieter Sounds  A Garageband Expertise</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/ai-powered-text-conversion-for-effective-presentations-for-2024/"><u>AI-Powered Text Conversion for Effective Presentations for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/thrifty-pc-frame-buffer-tools-for-2024/"><u>Thrifty PC Frame Buffer Tools for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-advanced-array-manipulations-and-sorting-algorithms-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Advanced Array Manipulations and Sorting Algorithms for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/best-android-data-recovery-retrieve-lost-photos-from-x6-pro-by-fonelab-android-recover-photos/"><u>Best Android Data Recovery - Retrieve Lost Photos from X6 Pro.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/approved-step-by-step-to-creating-an-unbeatable-biz-youtube-channel/"><u>2024 Approved  Step-by-Step to Creating an Unbeatable Biz YouTube Channel</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-webster.techidaily.com/approved-step-by-step-building-free-youtube-intro-videos/"><u>2024 Approved  Step-by-Step  Building FREE YouTube Intro Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-captivate-your-circle-the-art-of-sending-gifs-on-snapchat/"><u>[New] In 2024, Captivate Your Circle  The Art of Sending Gifs on Snapchat</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-posts.techidaily.com/new-spark-interest-on-instagram-with-top-unboxing-video-techniques-for-2024/"><u>[New] Spark Interest on Instagram with Top Unboxing Video Techniques for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ed-youtube-captioning-for-clearer-communication/"><u>[Updated] YouTube Captioning for Clearer Communication</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/vintage-virtue-an-examination-of-the-goofy-saga-for-2024/"><u>Vintage Virtue  An Examination of 'The Goofy Saga' For 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/new-finding-the-central-node-of-youtube-video-management-for-2024/"><u>[New] Finding the Central Node of YouTube Video Management for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Elevate-Your-Videos-A-Complete-Shift-From-SDR-to-HDR"><a href="#Elevate-Your-Videos-A-Complete-Shift-From-SDR-to-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Elevate Your Videos: A Complete Shift From SDR to HDR"></a>Elevate Your Videos: A Complete Shift From SDR to HDR</h2><p><em>“I shot HDR video clips with the camera for my YouTube videos, but part of the footage is SDR, I hope to get a consistent video presentation, how could I do?”</em></p><p><em>So what do you do with all of your existing SDR content? To solve this, SDR to HDR conversion or vice versa can be one of the best solutions. So let’s take a further look at the available options to create amazing upconversions.</em></p><h2 id="Can-I-convert-the-SDR-video-to-HDR"><a href="#Can-I-convert-the-SDR-video-to-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Can I convert the SDR video to HDR?"></a>Can I convert the SDR video to HDR?</h2><p>Before diving into concrete steps, it’s best to have a decent understanding of how it works. Changing from SDR to HDR is possible, but with specific sequences, the results can vary accordingly. Of course, the video’s original quality would influence how it looks in the final outcome, even if you convert it into the high dynamic range or HDR version.</p><p>The camera noise and compression artifacts that are available in the video file will become more enhanced after the upconverting process. This means more clean-up work during and after the processing will become necessary. So, <strong>converting SDR to HDR</strong> successfully from the source file will not change entirely in some methods.</p><p>Given all that, does it even need to convert SDF video into HDR, you may ask. The answer is yes. Here are some reasons why:</p><ul><li><strong>Dark&#x2F;Light Balance</strong></li></ul><p>HDR content assures more light-and-dark balance in the videos&#x2F;images captured compared to the displayed version. The HDR video files have more defined highlights and shadows and noticeable luminance differences in scenes. So, the imagery is more realistic whether one clicks pictures outdoors or indoors, during the day or night.</p><ul><li><strong>3D Effect</strong></li></ul><p>Videos with a high dynamic range have enhanced depth perception. So, the surface objects are more noticeable, with perceptible shadows under the object against the background. Therefore, the files have a three-dimensional effect after you turn <strong>SDR to HDR.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>A wide color gamut is available</strong></li></ul><p>HDR video comes with the availability of a wider color gamut that is not supported under SDR. With HDR, it is possible to expand the luminance and contrast levels, and color gradients are more prominent. To note, SDR monitors run with the Rec.709 colorspace spectrum, while HDR supports a wider Rec.2020 colorspace with more color variations.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Up-mapping-SDR-Archive-Content-to-HDR"><a href="#Method-1-Up-mapping-SDR-Archive-Content-to-HDR" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Up-mapping SDR Archive Content to HDR"></a>Method 1: Up-mapping SDR Archive Content to HDR</h3><p>It is possible to <strong>convert SDR to HDR</strong> after the legacy video-based content is mastered or recorded in SDR quality. Here, one can upconvert the content quality to HDR using the inverse tone mapping procedure. There are three content types that fall under the SDR Archive Content version:</p><ul><li><strong>SDR live-captured video content that comes with uncontrolled lighting</strong>. An example here includes Live Outdoor Sports shooting.</li><li><strong>SDR live-captured video content is available with controlled lighting</strong>. Examples include concerts, studio content recordings, and Indoor Sports shooting.</li><li><strong>Post-produced or mastered SDR content</strong>. These examples are documentaries and movies.</li></ul><p>Two sequences are available for upconverting SDR content from the archive to HDR. A suitable method would be to use the inverse tone-mapping functionality to set the HDR effect on the SDR content.</p><p>This process makes the SDR clips blend smoothly into the HDR content after you remaster them. You can use the real-time inverse tone-mapping tools and converters to make the SDR to HDR conversion.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Up-convert-SDR-clips-to-HDR-with-Video-editing-Software"><a href="#Method-2-Up-convert-SDR-clips-to-HDR-with-Video-editing-Software" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Up-convert SDR clips to HDR with Video-editing Software"></a>Method 2: Up-convert SDR clips to HDR with Video-editing Software</h3><p>One of the best ways to convert SDR to HDR is to use video editing software. Not every editor supports SDR to HDR conversion, but <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> does, especially with new upgrades since the v.11.5.4 version. Upgrades are visible under BorisFX effects, like the improved split mode function, Denoise effects, etc.</p><p>Additionally, it supports almost all kinds of formats, like MP4, M4V, MPG, VOB, HDR, and WMV. The gamut of tools allows easy customization and editing of the HDR video.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><strong>How to Use Filmora for SDR Video to HDR Conversion?</strong></p><p>Step1Install and open Filmora software on your PC or Mac.</p><p>Step2Press the “New Project” choice.</p><p>Step3Access “Click here to import media” &gt; Insert the SDR-quality video file in MPEG-1&#x2F;MPEG-2&#x2F;MPEG-4 or other video file formats.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/sdr-to-hdr-video-conversion-1.jpg"                      alt="insert sdr video file"                ></p><p>Step4Drag the video to the editing timeline below.</p><p>Step5Make edits like audio ducking, keyframing, chroma key background removal, adding filters, etc.</p><p>Step6Open Effects &gt; BorisFX &gt; Download.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/sdr-to-hdr-video-conversion-10.jpg"                      alt="open borisfx"                ></p><p>Step7Choose among the newer options like BCC Optical Diffusion, BCC Warp, and BCC Grads and Tints to upconvert to HDR quality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/sdr-to-hdr-video-conversion-11.jpg"                      alt="upconvert to hdr quality"                ></p><p>Step8Click on the Export button.</p><p>Step9Choose the Local tab and choose the video format for exporting.

Virtual Reality</h2><h1 id="What’s-the-difference-between-360°-video-and-VR-video"><a href="#What’s-the-difference-between-360°-video-and-VR-video" class="headerlink" title="What’s the difference between 360° video and VR video?"></a>What’s the difference between 360° video and VR video?</h1><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><h5 id="Benjamin-Arango"><a href="#Benjamin-Arango" class="headerlink" title="Benjamin Arango"></a>Benjamin Arango</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p> If you’ve been active in the media community you’ve undoubtedly heard of virtual reality video, leading many people to believe that it’s the next big thing in the world of film when in reality, it’s the current big thing that everyone’s been talking about. In fact, the newest innovation is 360° video and although they both sound like the same technology, they are actually quite different.</p><h2 id="The-Differences-Between-VR-Video-and-360°-Video"><a href="#The-Differences-Between-VR-Video-and-360°-Video" class="headerlink" title="The Differences Between VR Video and 360° Video"></a>The Differences Between VR Video and 360° Video</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/difference-between-vr-360-video.jpg"                      alt="difference between 360 video and VR"                ></p><h3 id="Photography"><a href="#Photography" class="headerlink" title="Photography"></a>Photography</h3><p> When it comes to looking at the photography of both mediums, that is where you’ll see the most significant differences between both VR video and 360° video. In a virtual reality environment, the photography is created digitally, as mentioned it is referred to as a virtual environment, or VE. A team of professionals creates these landscapes, characters, and elements typically within a digital studio and with the help of computers and software programs.</p><p> In comparison, 360° video is captured from a real-life landscape. These live action videos are not reconstructions of things that you would see in your everyday life, they are real videos in real places that everyone has access to.</p><h3 id="Mobility"><a href="#Mobility" class="headerlink" title="Mobility"></a>Mobility</h3><p> It’s also interesting to consider the amount of mobility that viewers have when it comes to both types of video, as virtual reality is far more immersive than 360° video. With virtual reality the viewer or player has the ability to walk relatively anywhere and explore further into the landscape. The only thing that may prevent you from venturing too far is if you are tethered to a computer or any other device that is providing you with the artificial landscape. Otherwise, you can easily walk absolutely anywhere while you are immersed in the world.</p><p> On the other side, a 360° video only gives you a certain amount of viewing power. Since the filmmaker will have full control over the content that you see, viewers will only have the ability to get a full view of what the filmmaker has filmed. The movements of the filmmaker limit the entire viewing field.</p><h3 id="Timeline"><a href="#Timeline" class="headerlink" title="Timeline"></a>Timeline</h3><p> One of the main reasons as to why VR video is so popular amongst video game studios is because they can integrate a vast timeline to keep their players entertained. With virtual reality the timeline could be endless as you can create a series of events or different experiences that exist in a theoretical world. The way that the timeline progresses depends on the actions of the user, whereas with 360° video, the timeline progresses based on what the filmmaker has filmed.</p><h3 id="Platform"><a href="#Platform" class="headerlink" title="Platform"></a>Platform</h3><p> When you consider the platforms that are available for both mediums, it can be more cost effective to use 360° video as users can access the video from any device that offers viewing capabilities and that is compatible with 360° videos. For example, they can log onto their computers and visit free websites such as YouTube to watch the video. With virtual reality you have to purchase particular accessories that support the program you’re involved in. Typically these can be quite expensive; Sony is releasing a VR headset for approximately the same price as an entire console.</p><h3 id="Content-Story"><a href="#Content-Story" class="headerlink" title="Content&#x2F;Story"></a>Content&#x2F;Story</h3><p> Creating the content and the story for VR is far more in-depth than 360° simply because the filmmaker doesn’t have control over what the viewer sees. You have to ensure that every crevice is designed perfectly to capture the attention of the audience and to impress them. You also have to pay special attention to enticing them to want to immerse themselves more in the environment. It’s equally as important to capture the attention of the viewer with 360° video, though you have full control of what your viewers can see.</p><p> Overall, both technologies are interesting and have shaped the way that we view content on a regular basis. Virtual reality seems to be a more in-depth technology that allows players to explore a brand new universe, whereas 360° video is great for real-life applications.</p><h2 id="What-is-Virtual-Reality-video"><a href="#What-is-Virtual-Reality-video" class="headerlink" title="What is Virtual Reality video"></a>What is Virtual Reality video</h2><p> Virtual Reality videois something that has been discussed everywhere from sci-fi films to video games all over the world. With VR video you are given the ability to immerse yourself in a specific scene that has been created by an animator. It is essentially a way to allow the user to explore a virtual environment in real-time. In comparison to a 360° video, virtual reality is like it name suggests, a reality that has been virtually created for your exploration.</p><h2 id="What-is-360°-Video"><a href="#What-is-360°-Video" class="headerlink" title="What is 360° Video"></a>What is 360° Video</h2><p> If you’re a fan of major YouTube personalities, you’ve undoubtedly seen 360° video before as companies have been developing innovations that allow people to record their daily lives with a 360° view. With a 360° you’re given the opportunity to watch a video from all angles of recording. Meaning that although a person might be recording their face, you can use controls on your device to see to the left, to the right, and even behind the camera. It’s a great way to make the viewer feel like they are actually in the same room as the filming personality.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/updated-creating-characters-in-the-metaverse-an-easy-methodology/"><u>[Updated] Creating Characters in the Metaverse  An Easy Methodology</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/leading-stock-pictures-tales-and-internet-fame/"><u>Leading Stock Pictures' Tales and Internet Fame</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/swift-and-precise-image-editing-ioss-leading-tools-for-erasure-techniques/"><u>Swift and Precise Image Editing  IOS's Leading Tools for Erasure Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/assessing-luminance-for-hd-raises-questions-for-2024/"><u>Assessing Luminance for HD Raises Questions for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-create-powerful-biz-decks-with-no-cost-templates/"><u>2024 Approved  Create Powerful Biz Decks with No-Cost Templates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/navigate-noisy-zoom-sounds-effective-remedies/"><u>Navigate Noisy Zoom Sounds  Effective Remedies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-beyond-the-headsets-the-essence-of-virtual-reality/"><u>2024 Approved  Beyond the Headsets  The Essence of Virtual Reality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-navigating-through-essential-zoom-recording-equipment/"><u>[New] Navigating Through Essential Zoom Recording Equipment</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-mastering-content-and-connections-insta-follower-rise/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Mastering Content & Connections  Insta-Follower Rise</u></a></li><li><a href="https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/what-to-do-if-your-iphone-15-pro-max-has-bad-esn-or-blacklisted-imei-by-drfone-ios/"><u>What to do if your iPhone 15 Pro Max has bad ESN or blacklisted IMEI?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-facebook-polling-in-communities/"><u>The Ultimate Guide to Facebook Polling in Communities</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/the-mechanics-of-parody-video-making-101-for-2024/"><u>The Mechanics of Parody  Video Making 101 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/updated-premium-apps-for-perfectly-altered-videos-on-ios-and-desktop/"><u>[Updated] Premium Apps for Perfectly Altered Videos on iOS & Desktop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/ultimate-guide-to-free-pptp-vpn-for-beginners-on-nubia-z50-ultra-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Ultimate Guide to Free PPTP VPN For Beginners On Nubia Z50 Ultra | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-capturing-your-xbox-playtime-for-sharing-for-2024/"><u>[New] Capturing Your Xbox Playtime for Sharing for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

So, keep reading.</p><ol><li><a href="#part4-1">Method 1: Create an RSS feed with hosting platforms</a></li><li><a href="#part4-2">Method 2: Create an RSS feed without a hosting platform</a></li><li><a href="#part4-3">Method 3: Create your own exclusive RSS feed</a></li></ol><ul><li><a href="#part5">Hot FAQs on Podcast RSS Feeds</a></li></ul><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-an-Podcast-RSS-Feed"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-an-Podcast-RSS-Feed" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is an Podcast RSS Feed?"></a>Part 1. What Is an Podcast RSS Feed?</h2><p>RSS, Really Simple Syndication, has been around for quite a long time (since 1999), and it was introduced to allow internet users to stay connected with their favorite websites. In other words, it’s used to subscribe to news websites, emails, blogs, podcasts, etc. It is just a simple link looking like this:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-1.jpg"                      alt="rss feed"                ></p><p>Your Podcast RSS feed makes the information about your podcast quickly accessible on various podcast directories, like Apple Podcast and Spotify. Yes, it holds the information about your podcast show and its episodes. So, whenever you create a new episode on the hosting website, it automatically updates it to podcast directories in real-time, thus making it accessible to listeners at their convenience.</p><p>Ultimately, an RSS feed saves you the stress of manually uploading new episodes of your podcast to various platforms! An RSS feed could also be referred to as;</p><ul><li>RSS channel</li><li>Newsfeed</li><li>RSS stream</li><li>Web feed</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-When-to-Use-an-RSS-Feed"><a href="#Part-2-When-to-Use-an-RSS-Feed" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. When to Use an RSS Feed"></a>Part 2. When to Use an RSS Feed</h2><p>The concept of an RSS feed is pretty simple. It is what bridges the gap between your content and internet users. It means it’s not only helpful to podcasters but also to websites, blogs, etc.</p><p>As we all know, the average internet user won’t always have the time to visit your website or podcast channel to check new posts. <strong>So, by using RSS Feed on your website, podcast channel, email, etc., it’ll be easy for them to stay updated with every new content you publish.</strong></p><p>RSS feed is necessary for any podcaster looking to thrive in the industry, and it’s the only way to allow your target audience to access your content quickly.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Do-I-Find-the-RSS-Feed-for-My-Podcast"><a href="#Part-3-How-Do-I-Find-the-RSS-Feed-for-My-Podcast" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How Do I Find the RSS Feed for My Podcast?"></a>Part 3. How Do I Find the RSS Feed for My Podcast?</h2><p>If you’ve uploaded podcasts to a hosting site and you’re wondering where to find the podcast RSS feed links, it’s pretty simple. You don’t need to do anything, as your RSS Feed will be automatically created once you set up your account on the platform.</p><p>Usually, the RSS feed can be found in Settings or the Directories tab. But, of course, that varies according to different hosting sites. So, we take buzzsprout as an example to show you how to get the RSS feed.</p><p>Step1 Open your podcast hosting website and navigate the Directories section. Then, locate any section tagged as Feed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-2.jpg"                      alt="find rss feed from the directories tab"                ></p><p>Step2 Click on the Feed button. You should see the podcast RSS feed. You can easily copy it from there.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-To-Create-an-RSS-Feed-for-a-Podcast"><a href="#Part-4-How-To-Create-an-RSS-Feed-for-a-Podcast" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. How To Create an RSS Feed for a Podcast?"></a>Part 4. How To Create an RSS Feed for a Podcast?</h2><p>However, there is also a case that if you use a self-hosted website for podcasting, you’ll require a plugin to generate your podcast RSS feeds. You can’t use it as it’ll include other blog content instead of the podcast, although your website might have its own RSS feed,</p><p>Then it’s high time to create a podcast RSS feed. Nevertheless, the process depends on whether you’re using a hosting service or not. Read on to find out how to create an RSS feed with or without a hosting platform;</p><h3 id="Method-1-Create-an-RSS-feed-with-hosting-platforms"><a href="#Method-1-Create-an-RSS-feed-with-hosting-platforms" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Create an RSS feed with hosting platforms"></a>Method 1: Create an RSS feed with hosting platforms</h3><p>As mentioned, once you create an account with a podcast hosting website, your podcast RSS Feed will be automatically created. So you just need to complete your account setup, and once you publish a new podcast episode, you can find the RSS Feed in the relevant section of the podcast hosting platform.</p><p>We used the Castos hosting website to generate a podcast RSS Feed in the steps below;</p><p>Step1 Visit Castos website and set up an account with them.</p><p>Step2 Create a new podcast episode and fill in all necessary details in the relevant boxes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-3.jpg"                      alt="create a new podcast episode"                ></p><p>Step3 Navigate to the Podcast Setting area and provide your podcast information, such as Title, Description, Cover art, etc. Afterward, click the relevant button to proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-4.jpg"                      alt="navigate to the podcast setting area"                ></p><p>Step4 Once you successfully save your podcast details and upload the new episode, navigate to the Dashboard and locate your Podcast RSS Feed in the Distribution tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-5.jpg"                      alt="rss feed castos"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Create-an-RSS-feed-without-a-hosting-platform"><a href="#Method-2-Create-an-RSS-feed-without-a-hosting-platform" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Create an RSS feed without a hosting platform"></a>Method 2: Create an RSS feed without a hosting platform</h3><p>Since the native RSS Feed of a self-hosted website usually contains blog article content, which is not needed in a podcast RSS Feed, you need a plugin like Powerpress to generate your podcast RSS feed.</p><p>The PowerPress plugin allows you to generate RSS feed containing only your podcast audio once you publish new content on your website. The following steps explain the process of creating an RSS feed without a hosting platform;</p><p>Step1 Open WordPress and log in to the backend of your WordPress website. Then, select Plugins from the left side and click Add New.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-6.jpg"                      alt="open wordpress"                ></p><p>Step2 Search Powerpress plugin and click the Install button next to “PowerPress Podcasting Plugin by Bluburry.

Click on it and select Settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-8.jpg"                      alt="select settings"                ></p><p>Step4 Click Feed, and you’ll see your RSS Feed link.

What Is an Podcast RSS Feed?</p><p>RSS, Really Simple Syndication, has been around for quite a long time (since 1999), and it was introduced to allow internet users to stay connected with their favorite websites. In other words, it’s used to subscribe to news websites, emails, blogs, podcasts, etc. It is just a simple link looking like this:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-1.jpg"                      alt="rss feed"                ></p><p>Your Podcast RSS feed makes the information about your podcast quickly accessible on various podcast directories, like Apple Podcast and Spotify. Yes, it holds the information about your podcast show and its episodes. So, whenever you create a new episode on the hosting website, it automatically updates it to podcast directories in real-time, thus making it accessible to listeners at their convenience.</p><p>Ultimately, an RSS feed saves you the stress of manually uploading new episodes of your podcast to various platforms! An RSS feed could also be referred to as;</p><ul><li>RSS channel</li><li>Newsfeed</li><li>RSS stream</li><li>Web feed</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-When-to-Use-an-RSS-Feed-1"><a href="#Part-2-When-to-Use-an-RSS-Feed-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. When to Use an RSS Feed"></a>Part 2. When to Use an RSS Feed</h2><p>The concept of an RSS feed is pretty simple. It is what bridges the gap between your content and internet users. It means it’s not only helpful to podcasters but also to websites, blogs, etc.</p><p>As we all know, the average internet user won’t always have the time to visit your website or podcast channel to check new posts. <strong>So, by using RSS Feed on your website, podcast channel, email, etc., it’ll be easy for them to stay updated with every new content you publish.</strong></p><p>RSS feed is necessary for any podcaster looking to thrive in the industry, and it’s the only way to allow your target audience to access your content quickly.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Do-I-Find-the-RSS-Feed-for-My-Podcast-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-Do-I-Find-the-RSS-Feed-for-My-Podcast-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. How Do I Find the RSS Feed for My Podcast?"></a>Part 3. How Do I Find the RSS Feed for My Podcast?</h2><p>If you’ve uploaded podcasts to a hosting site and you’re wondering where to find the podcast RSS feed links, it’s pretty simple. You don’t need to do anything, as your RSS Feed will be automatically created once you set up your account on the platform.</p><p>Usually, the RSS feed can be found in Settings or the Directories tab. But, of course, that varies according to different hosting sites. So, we take buzzsprout as an example to show you how to get the RSS feed.</p><p>Step1 Open your podcast hosting website and navigate the Directories section. Then, locate any section tagged as Feed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-2.jpg"                      alt="find rss feed from the directories tab"                ></p><p>Step2 Click on the Feed button. You should see the podcast RSS feed. You can easily copy it from there.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-To-Create-an-RSS-Feed-for-a-Podcast-1"><a href="#Part-4-How-To-Create-an-RSS-Feed-for-a-Podcast-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4. How To Create an RSS Feed for a Podcast?"></a>Part 4. How To Create an RSS Feed for a Podcast?</h2><p>However, there is also a case that if you use a self-hosted website for podcasting, you’ll require a plugin to generate your podcast RSS feeds. You can’t use it as it’ll include other blog content instead of the podcast, although your website might have its own RSS feed,</p><p>Then it’s high time to create a podcast RSS feed. Nevertheless, the process depends on whether you’re using a hosting service or not. Read on to find out how to create an RSS feed with or without a hosting platform;</p><h3 id="Method-1-Create-an-RSS-feed-with-hosting-platforms-1"><a href="#Method-1-Create-an-RSS-feed-with-hosting-platforms-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Create an RSS feed with hosting platforms"></a>Method 1: Create an RSS feed with hosting platforms</h3><p>As mentioned, once you create an account with a podcast hosting website, your podcast RSS Feed will be automatically created. So you just need to complete your account setup, and once you publish a new podcast episode, you can find the RSS Feed in the relevant section of the podcast hosting platform.</p><p>We used the Castos hosting website to generate a podcast RSS Feed in the steps below;</p><p>Step1 Visit Castos website and set up an account with them.</p><p>Step2 Create a new podcast episode and fill in all necessary details in the relevant boxes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-3.jpg"                      alt="create a new podcast episode"                ></p><p>Step3 Navigate to the Podcast Setting area and provide your podcast information, such as Title, Description, Cover art, etc. Afterward, click the relevant button to proceed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-4.jpg"                      alt="navigate to the podcast setting area"                ></p><p>Step4 Once you successfully save your podcast details and upload the new episode, navigate to the Dashboard and locate your Podcast RSS Feed in the Distribution tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/create-podcast-rss-feeds-5.jpg"                      alt="rss feed castos"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Create-an-RSS-feed-without-a-hosting-platform-1"><a href="#Method-2-Create-an-RSS-feed-without-a-hosting-platform-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Create an RSS feed without a hosting platform"></a>Method 2: Create an RSS feed without a hosting platform</h3><p>Since the native RSS Feed of a self-hosted website usually contains blog article content, which is not needed in a podcast RSS Feed, you need a plugin like Powerpress to generate your podcast RSS feed.</p><p>The PowerPress plugin allows you to generate RSS feed containing only your podcast audio once you publish new content on your website.

Both choices may be used for free. You can quickly book, join, and manage Zoom meetings from the mobile or desktop versions of your personal Gmail and Google Calendar by using the Zoom for G-Suite add-on. You’ll get a popup on your screen stating “Zoom for Gmail has been installed” when the installation is complete.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/install-zoom-for-gmail.jpg"                      alt="install zoom for gmail"                ></p><h5 id="Step3Log-into-your-own-Google-Account"><a href="#Step3Log-into-your-own-Google-Account" class="headerlink" title="Step3Log into your own Google Account"></a>Step3Log into your own Google Account</h5><p>Launch your web browser and open Gmail.

Install it after logging out of all other Google accounts and signing into the one you wish to add it to. Another feature of the Zoom for Gmail add-on is the ability to book a Zoom conference directly from Gmail. The meeting subject will automatically be pulled from the email subject line into the Google Calendar event. Simply login into Gmail in your browser and start a new email message to begin organizing Zoom meetings. Here’s how to set up a Zoom meeting on your Google Calendar and invite participants:</p><p><strong>Steps to Use Zoom for Gmail</strong></p><p>Step1 Install the “Zoom for G-Suite” plugin, that is free, from the official G-Suite store after logging into your Google account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/install-zoom-for-gsuite.jpg"                      alt="install zoom for gsuite"                ></p><p>To get install rights if you are using an enterprise account, get in touch with your IT administrator. A lot of rights, including complete access to your whole contact list, are also required by the add-on. Skip this technique and look at Method 2, which does not need the add-on, if that makes you uncomfortable.</p><p>Step2 Now open Google Calendar, and on the right side of the window, locate the Zoom symbol. To log into your Zoom account using the add-on, click the icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/zoom-in-google-calendar.jpg"                      alt="zoom in google calendar"                ></p><p>Step3 Turn on “Pre-approve” and adhere to the on-screen instructions to provide the app access to your Google account information.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/enable-pre-approve.jpg"                      alt="enable pre approve"                ></p><p>Step4 Next, check for the “Add Conferencing” box when creating a new Google Calendar event. Then, pick “Zoom Meeting” from the list of possibilities by clicking on the drop-down menu. At the bottom, click “Preserve” to save your selection.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-conference-google-calendar.jpg"                      alt="add conference google calendar"                ></p><p>Step5 The Meeting ID, password, and passcode will now be automatically filled in by the add-on in the Calendar event. Additionally, it will provide a link with joining instructions, which should be helpful for anyone who are unfamiliar with Zoom. You may now invite people to the meeting by clicking on the freshly created event in Google Calendar and using the “Add Guests” section. Finally, choose the “envelope” symbol to send guests an email invitation.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/add-guests-zoom-meeting.jpg"                      alt="add guests zoom meeting"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Tips-to-Use-Zoom-for-Gmail"><a href="#Part-3-Tips-to-Use-Zoom-for-Gmail" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Tips to Use Zoom for Gmail"></a>Part 3. Tips to Use Zoom for Gmail</h2><p>Two of the most popular productivity tools are Zoom and G Suite, which are utilized by both businesses and individuals.

Because the add-on requests a ton of permissions, including full access to your complete contact list, it is really the most private alternative. Keep in mind, too, that using the manual way will not sync your meetings between Zoom and Calendar for you. If you’re okay with that, the following instructions will show you how to add a Zoom invite link to Google Calendar without the add-on:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/calendar-link-addition-meeting.jpg"                      alt="calendar link addition meeting"                ></p><ul><li>Create a new meeting by using the Zoom client on your PC (or Android or iOS phone). Then, on the Meetings page, select the “Copy Invitation” option.</li><li>Open a web browser and log in to Google. After that, enter Google Calendar and manually paste the meeting details into the “Notes” area at the bottom before adding the Zoom invite link. Finally, choose “Save.” As previously mentioned, you may now use the email link to add guests and send invitations.</li><li>After accepting the invitation, the participants will see the meeting link in their Google Calendar and be able to join by clicking the link or the “Join Zoom Meeting” option.</li></ul><h3 id="Make-a-Video-Recording-of-the-Call"><a href="#Make-a-Video-Recording-of-the-Call" class="headerlink" title="Make a Video Recording of the Call"></a>Make a Video Recording of the Call</h3><p>Zoom’s web conferencing call recording as video capability is useful for sharing the conference with individuals who may have missed it or for evaluating the conversation. You must choose either the local or cloud option while recording. Local refers to storing the video file on your own devices, such as your computer or an external storage device.</p><p>Use the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> screen recorder for the much simpler experience. With the help of the Filmora screen recorder, users may simultaneously record their screen and camera as well as the audio from their system and microphone. It is possible to preserve any material on Filmora. Screen recording is the best approach to save any pleasure on your monitor. The reach may be captured together with web-based real-time recordings, video chats, and much more using screen recording and video editing tools. You may capture anything on your screen and store it.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/make-recording-of-zoom-call.jpg"                      alt="make recording of zoom call"                ></p><h3 id="Create-Meeting-Template"><a href="#Create-Meeting-Template" class="headerlink" title="Create Meeting Template"></a>Create Meeting Template</h3><p>With one URL and preserved settings, create recurring meetings. You may set up a recurring meeting with Zoom for weekly meetings, monthly check-ins, and other regularly scheduled calls. The use of this option has two advantages. First of all, you may set all the call preferences you’d like once and have them remain in effect each time you meet. Second, because repeating calls utilize the same join URL each time, you never need to provide attendees with a new one.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/create-zoom-meeting-template.jpg"                      alt="create zoo mmeeting template"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In a nutshell, so that everyone can arrive on time, you would be able to easily choose “Zoom Meeting” inside your Google Calendar event and create a link to join it. When you include a Zoom meeting in your calendar invitation, all participants may join the meeting by simply clicking the meeting’s details and then clicking again. There is no need to log into Zoom or look through emails to get access. In addition to providing capabilities that let you fully manage the screen recording process, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is also video editing software that enables you to edit your recordings anyway you see fit.
